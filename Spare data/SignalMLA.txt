[Drafting notes:1. The MLA will be re-drafted to address the legal and commercial issues raised by Head Leases for Sites housing RTTs and/or RTPs, but which also include in-building solutions ("IBS") (a new definition of "Combined Sites" will be created to identify such Sites). We would propose that: (i) The Combined Site’s Head Lease is transferred to the TowerCo by OpCo under the Asset Transfer Agreement, and it would then form the subject of an LLA under the MLA. (ii) If the Head Lease specifies separately the price for the IBS and RTT/RTP components, then the TowerCo will pass through the IBS component to the OpCo plus any tax or transfer pricing. (iii) If the Head Lease does not specify separately the price for the IBS and RTT/RTP components, then the OpCo will pay the difference between the total lease cost for the Combined Site, and the average lease of a similar Rooftop site in that geographical area (and in the case of disagreement of the cost of such average lease cost the matter will be referred to Expert Determination).2. WIP Site drafting needs to be added (whereby Sites in respect of which construction has commenced but not completed as at the Effective Date will count towards OpCo’s satisfaction of the Annual Commitment for Year 1).Agreed, save that TowerCo notes:- WIP sites should be fully funded in the OpCo to count towards the annual commitment. - Note our understanding that site acquisition stage means that no ground lease has been signed. It is agreed that a site shall become  WIP Site once a purchase order/work order has been issued in respect of that site. 3. Schedule 2 (Charges) needs to be updated.4. All x-refs need to be checked.5. Definitions need to be checked to ensure consistent use.6. Territory-specific wording needs to be removed and added to the relevant MLA rider.]    DATED2023(1)                 - and -(2)                 MASTER LEASE AGREEMENTTABLE OF CONTENTS1Clause	Headings					Page1.

Prior to the installation, movement, replacement, modification or upgrade of OpCo Equipment, OpCo shall provide TowerCo with at least five (5) Working Days prior written notice (except in emergency situations, in which case OpCo shall endeavour to provide TowerCo with as much written notice as reasonably possible in the circumstances). In the event OpCo fails to provide such notice to TowerCo, unless the relevant Equipment is Unauthorised Equipment, OpCo will promptly pay to TowerCo an amount of US$25 in each instance, which TowerCo will set off against any Service Credits owing to OpCo from time to time (without prejudice to any other rights and remedies of TowerCo under this Agreement or otherwise). (c) TowerCo will reimburse OpCo for all of its costs properly documented and reasonably incurred in connection with any Relocation or Consolidation of Sites where such Relocation or Consolidation is required by TowerCo (except in the case of Mandatory Relocation where clause 9.6 shall apply) including by:(i) paying all of OpCo's costs, reasonably incurred, of removing and installing OpCo Equipment; and(ii) compensating OpCo for the full value of its operational costs, reasonably incurred, of managing such Relocation or Consolidation (including all out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by OpCo in connection with such Relocation or Consolidation).(d) TowerCo agrees that it will procure that each Third Party tenant of each Site will exercise any rights to install, modify, replace or relocate Equipment on such Site in a manner that will not interfere with the OpCo Equipment at such Site. In the event OpCo experiences interference with OpCo Equipment caused by the installation, modification, replacement or movement by another tenant of its Equipment at the same Site, or the use or occupation by such Third Party tenant of that Site, TowerCo will take, or cause the interfering Third Party to take, all actions necessary to eliminate such interference as soon as possible and in any event no later than forty-eight (48) hours after receiving such notice from OpCo that such interference is prevailing or from the point at which TowerCo independently discovers or is made aware by a Third Party that interference is prevailing (whichever is earlier), up to and including causing such other tenant to cease operations until the interference is eliminated. (e) In the event that a Third Party tenant experiences interference to its Equipment and such interference is demonstrably caused by OpCo or its Equipment as a result the operation of such Equipment outside the parameters permitted by the Regulatory Authority, following notice from TowerCo, OpCo will take all actions necessary to eliminate such interference as soon as possible and in any event no later than forty-eight (48) hours after receiving such notice from TowerCo.

In addition, OpCo shall obtain TowerCo's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, in each instance prior to commencing any such works relating to any OpCo Fibre Connections so as to minimise disruption to the use and operation of a Site and Equipment by TowerCo and Third Parties.(b) Except as otherwise agreed between the Parties, TowerCo will not allow any of its other tenants to access OpCo Fibre Connections, provided that (subject to having the necessary license to sell such services): (i) TowerCo and OpCo may enter into one or more separate agreements whereby OpCo permits TowerCo to sell OpCo Fibre Connections to such other tenants of one or more relevant Sites; and(ii) OpCo will itself be entitled to sell or otherwise to provide access to OpCo Fibre Connections to Third Party tenants at any relevant Site.(c) In exchange for TowerCo allowing OpCo to install, operate, and maintain any OpCo Fibre Connections, OpCo will promptly pay TowerCo ten percent (10%) of the recurring revenue paid by the Third Party tenant to OpCo or an Affiliate of OpCo during the term of any Third Party tenant's agreement with OpCo in relation to each such fibre connections. 4.9 Backhaul and Edge Data CentreWhere requested by OpCo and technically feasible in TowerCo's sole discretion (for example, without requiring upgrades to, or strengthening of, Facilities or acquiring a lease (or extension of an existing lease) over additional land), TowerCo will provide backhaul and edge data centre services on reasonable commercial terms and subject to a separate commercial agreement in writing between the Parties.4.10 TitleTowerCo will be responsible for registering OpCo’s interest in the Sites, in the land on which the Sites are situated or in any leases in respect of the same, to the extent that any such interest is required to be registered in compliance with applicable Law.4.11 Ancillary Rights(a) TowerCo agrees that OpCo's permitted use of Space allocated to OpCo at each Site pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement includes such non-exclusive rights as are necessary or desirable to enable OpCo (or a Third Party on behalf of OpCo) to install, connect and maintain additional utility wires, cables, fibres and conduits to the OpCo Equipment and if additional rights or other agreements are required by any utility company or relevant Third Party, TowerCo will assist OpCo with obtaining the same and obtaining execution or other approvals by other parties owning any interest in the Site, if required, and TowerCo has no right to prevent such installation so long as the standard of installation of the foregoing is consistent with standard industry practice and this Agreement, except that TowerCo will have the right to approve the route and manner of installation of the foregoing so long as such approval is not unreasonably withheld. In addition, OpCo shall obtain TowerCo's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, in each instance prior to commencing any works relating to such installation, connection, and maintenance so as to minimise disruption to the use and operation of a Site and Equipment by TowerCo and Third Parties.(b) With regard to OpCo's exercise of the rights contemplated in clause 4.11(a) above:(i) no amount will be payable by OpCo to TowerCo in connection with the creation, modification, operation, access to or use of any Space in accordance with such rights;(ii) no amount will be payable by OpCo to TowerCo in connection with the installation of any Equipment to give effect to such rights; (iii) as reasonably required by OpCo, TowerCo will (without charge) assist OpCo to develop conduits for the passage and installation of fibre optic cabling at and to the OpCo Equipment located at each relevant Site; and(iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this clause 4.11, any such rights of OpCo and the installation of any Equipment will be subject to the provisions of the relevant Head Lease with respect to any Acquired Sites, and TowerCo will not be required to make any changes or additional payments in connection with any such rights or any installation of Equipment.4.12 Unauthorised Equipment(a) If TowerCo discovers that OpCo has installed additional Equipment in excess of the Reserved Space or Excess Space without paying the applicable Charges in contravention of this Agreement ("Unauthorised Equipment"), TowerCo shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, make OpCo aware of any deployment of Unauthorised Equipment and OpCo shall within thirty (30) days of written notice from TowerCo notifying OpCo of such Unauthorised Equipment (an "Unauthorised Equipment Notice"), either:(i) remove the Unauthorised Equipment at OpCo's sole cost and without causing any damage to the Site or damage or disruption to any Equipment of TowerCo or a Third Party; or (ii) subject to there being available and contiguous space and technical feasibility, as determined by TowerCo acting reasonably, at the Site, keep the Unauthorised Equipment at the relevant Site, and the Parties shall execute an amendment to the relevant LLA where the amendment shall include: (i) details of the Unauthorised Equipment on the relevant Site; and (ii) the Excess Space Fees payable for such Unauthorised Equipment in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (and such Unauthorised Equipment shall then be deemed OpCo Equipment for the purposes of this Agreement). (b) Notwithstanding clause 4.12(a)(i) and 4.12(a)(ii), OpCo shall promptly pay to TowerCo an amount equal to the relevant Charges for the Space which the Unauthorised Equipment occupied from the later of either the Effective Date or the date of initial installation of the Unauthorised Equipment reasonably evidenced by TowerCo plus twelve (12) months of such Charges (which shall be charged as Excess Space Fees), upon payment of which the relevant Unauthorised Equipment shall be authorised. For the avoidance of doubt, no Equipment deployed in connection with OpCo’s use of Grandfathered Excess Space shall constitute Unauthorised Equipment subject always to clause 4.4(b)(i)(C).(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if TowerCo notifies OpCo that any Unauthorised Equipment or OpCo Equipment is, in TowerCo's determination acting reasonably unsafe and poses an imminent hazard to the integrity of the Site and/or to personal safety, then OpCo shall remove such Unauthorised Equipment or OpCo Equipment within five (5) Working Days after the date of notice, failing which TowerCo may remove such Unauthorised Equipment or OpCo Equipment.4.13 Optimisation (a) Upon written request from TowerCo in respect of a identified single Site (an "Optimisation Request"), OpCo will use its reasonable endeavours to optimise the Reserved Space and Excess Space (as applicable) occupied by OpCo at that Site in order to release space and windloading capacity on a Tower and to release ground or shelter space at the Site so that TowerCo to accommodate one or more additional Tower Tenants at that Site or allow a Tower Tenant to use available Space at that Site, provided always that:(i) nothing shall in this clause 4.13 shall require OpCo to consent to Relocation to a separate Site;(ii) TowerCo shall provide OpCo with not less than thirty (30) Working Days prior written notice of an Optimisation Request; (iii) OpCo shall not be required to take any action which would, at OpCo’s reasonable determination, adversely affect the capacity and coverage of OpCo Equipment at such Site, or adversely affect the Service Levels delivered at the Site during or after such optimisation; (iv) TowerCo shall within thirty (30) Working Days reimburse OpCo for its reasonable, pre-agreed external Third Party costs of any optimisation (i.e. actual costs only and excluding any overheads) by OpCo under this clause 4.13(a), and OpCo shall not be required to take any action until such time as the Parties have pre-agreed the costs (i.e. actual costs only and excluding any overheads) of any optimisation which will be incurred by OpCo and reimbursed by TowerCo;(v) TowerCo shall provide OpCo with an estimate of the available Space at the Site that will be created by the relevant optimisation;(vi) TowerCo may not serve more than one Optimisation Request in respect of a single Site in any five (5) year period; (vii) all optimisation by OpCo in accordance with this clause 4.13(a) shall be in accordance with Good Industry Practice; and (viii) OpCo is not required to take any action in response to an Optimisation Request if there are amounts due to OpCo from TowerCo which are overdue for costs incurred by OpCo for any previous Optimisation Request.(b) OpCo shall respond to an Optimisation Request within ten (10) Working Days after receiving it, with a written notice to TowerCo confirming either:(i) that it is not able to comply with the Optimisation Request, including details of why it is not able to comply;(ii) that it is able to comply with the Optimisation Request, including: (i) the external Third Party cost to be incurred by OpCo in respect of that optimisation; and (ii) whether it can achieve the estimate of the available Space that will be created by the relevant optimisation as set out in clause 4.13(a); or(iii) if the relevant optimisation cannot be completed within thirty (30) Working Days, the period required to complete the relevant optimisation.(c) If TowerCo responds to OpCo within five (5) Working Days after receipt of confirmation under clause 4.13(b)(ii) confirming that it wishes OpCo to proceed with the relevant optimisation (and that it will reimburse the external Third Party costs of the optimisation specified in that notice), OpCo shall complete that optimisation within thirty (30) Working Days after TowerCo's confirmation under this clause 4.13(c) or such longer period stipulated by the OpCo in the notice under clause 4.13(b)(ii) and agreed in writing by TowerCo (acting reasonably), taking into account the number of Optimisation Requests outstanding at the time. Any Dispute in respect of the external Third Party costs incurred by OpCo for the optimisation will be resolved in accordance with the Dispute Resolution Procedure.(d) If TowerCo wishes to undertake any optimisation works in respect of Sheltered Space at a Site in order to accommodate the requirements of any Tower Tenant in connection with any actual or proposed colocation agreement between TowerCo and Tower Tenant, OpCo shall cooperate with TowerCo in good faith to agree, where practical and reasonable, a written project plan for the optimisation, which shall be undertaken at the cost of the TowerCo, provided always that:(i) OpCo shall not be required to take any action which would, at OpCo’s reasonable determination, adversely affect the operations of OpCo at such Site, or adversely affect the Service Levels delivered at the Site during or after such optimisation; (ii) requests in relation to Sheltered Space under this clause 4.13(d) shall be counted towards the limit on total Optimisation Requests under clause 4.13(a)(vi); (iii) the parties shall comply with clauses 4.13(b) and 4.13(c) above in responding to and fulfilling a Sheltered Space request; and(iv) all optimisation by OpCo in accordance with this paragraph shall be in accordance with Good Industry Practice.4.14 Headleases(a) Unless expressly provided for in this Agreement or otherwise agreed to by OpCo in writing, if there are no further renewal options under a Head Lease, TowerCo shall use its best endeavours to negotiate and obtain an extension or renewal of the Head Lease avoiding an Above Market Increase in rent.(b) TowerCo shall, not later than 30 (thirty) months prior to the expiration date of any Head Lease and at least on a monthly basis thereafter, update OpCo on the status of any negotiations for the extension or renegotiation of the relevant Head Lease. (c) If notwithstanding TowerCo having used its best endeavours to avoid an Above Market Increase, the Head Lessor is requiring, as a condition of agreeing to the renewal or extension of a Head Lease for a Site that TowerCo agrees to pay a rent which represents an Above Market Increase, TowerCo will promptly notify OpCo in writing advising it of such Above Market Increase. If:(i) within 90 days following such notice, OpCo notifies TowerCo in writing that OpCo will pay fifty percent (50%) of the incremental rent over and above the Above Market Increase with regard to such Site, TowerCo will use best endeavours to negotiate and obtain an extension or renewal of the Head Lease; or(ii) OpCo indicates to TowerCo it is not willing to pay fifty percent (50%) of the incremental rent over and above the Above Market Increase for such Site, then TowerCo shall be obliged to Relocate OpCo Equipment to an alternative Site, and TowerCo shall cover its own costs of Relocation, and all OpCo’s costs of Relocation (i.e. actual costs only and excluding any overheads).  (d) OpCo acknowledges and agrees that TowerCo will not be in breach of its obligations under this Agreement if it fails to agree a renewal or extension of a Head Lease if it is and has always been in compliance with the terms of the Head Lease and it has complied with this clause 4, and:(i) OpCo has not notified TowerCo in accordance with clause 4.14(c);(ii) the Head Lessor has refused to renew or to extend a Head Lease;(iii) the Head Lessor has terminated a Head Lease in accordance with its terms (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, as a result any act or omission of TowerCo); or(iv) the Head Lessor terminates the Head Lease unlawfully or otherwise not in accordance with the provisions of the Head Lease.5. STRATEGIC SITES5.1 If a Site is designated as a Strategic Site in any LLA or is reclassified as such pursuant to clauses 5.8, 5.11 or 9.11, the provisions of this clause 5 will apply.5.2 Unless otherwise agreed by OpCo in writing, each Strategic Site must remain exclusive to OpCo for the duration of the Strategic Site Period.5.3 During the Strategic Site Period, TowerCo may not enter into any lease or other analogous agreement over a Strategic Site (in whole or part) with any Third Party or otherwise allow any use or occupation of a Strategic Site by any Third Party (collectively, "Third Party Arrangements") without obtaining OpCo’s prior written consent.5.4 If TowerCo wishes to enter into a Third Party Arrangement, TowerCo must: (i) give advance written notice to OpCo; and (ii) provide all such details as OpCo may request (including the identity of the Third Party, the nature and duration of the proposed arrangement and the price payable (provided that if TowerCo is subject to third party obligations of confidentiality which prevent such disclosure, the price payable will be subject to an independent audit reasonably requested by OpCo if they have reasonable suspicion that such audit is necessary)). Upon receipt of all such information, OpCo will, within twenty (20) Working Days, inform TowerCo in writing whether or not it consents to entry by TowerCo into the relevant Third Party Arrangement.5.5 If OpCo consents to TowerCo entering into such a Third Party Arrangement, the Charges payable by OpCo for the relevant Strategic Site will be reduced in accordance with clause 14.4, and it will no longer be deemed a Strategic Site.5.6 If OpCo withholds its consent to the proposed Third Party Arrangement:(a) TowerCo will not enter into such Third Party Arrangement (with the effect that OpCo’s exclusive occupation of the relevant Strategic Site is preserved); and(b) TowerCo may increase the Base Rental Fees payable for that Strategic Site by a sum equal to the additional rental fees that TowerCo would otherwise have gained by leasing Space at such Strategic Site to the relevant Third Party (subject to providing OpCo with written evidence that such relevant Third Party had consented to, or agreed in principle to, pay such rental fees) and provided always that the Base Rental Fees for any Site may not be increased by more than seventy percent (70%) ("Strategic Site Premium").5.7 For the avoidance of doubt, any multi-tenant discount or discounted rates offered to the relevant Third Party must be taken into account when calculating increased Base Rental Fees pursuant to clause 5.6(b).5.8 No later than fifteen (15) days before the expiry of the Strategic Site Period for any Site, TowerCo will provide written notice to OpCo of the same ("Strategic Site Term Notice"), upon receipt of which OpCo shall confirm in writing to TowerCo within a reasonable period of time:(a) that such Site is to remain a Strategic Site (whereupon the Strategic Site Period will renew with respect to such Site) for the same period of time; or(b) that such Site will cease to be a Strategic Site, in which case TowerCo and OpCo may mutually agree in writing to redesignate any Sole Occupancy Site to be a Strategic Site in substitution (provided that TowerCo will not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to any such proposed redesignation) ("New Strategic Site") (whereupon the Strategic Site Period will take effect over the New Strategic Site),provided that there will be no increase to the aggregate number of Strategic Sites during the Term, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties. The aggregate number of Strategic Sites in the Territory is [x].7  5.9 In the event that TowerCo fails to provide a Strategic Site Term Notice (or OpCo fails to provide a response) in respect of any relevant Site in accordance with clause 5.8, such Site will, on a rolling basis, continue to be treated as a Strategic Site until such time as OpCo confirms in writing:(a) that such Site is to remain a Strategic Site (whereupon the Strategic Site Period will renew with respect to such Site); or(b) that such Site will cease to be a Strategic Site, in which case TowerCo and OpCo may mutually agree in writing to on a New Strategic Site in substitution (provided that TowerCo will not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to any such proposed substitution, and whereupon the Strategic Site Period will take effect over the New Strategic Site),provided that there will be no increase to the aggregate number of Strategic Sites during the Term, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties.5.10 If a Site ceases to be a Strategic Site, TowerCo may, in its sole discretion, collocate Third Parties on the Site or otherwise enter into Third Party Arrangements in respect of such Site in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (and the higher of the Colocation Discount and the Most Favoured Customer Discount will then apply in respect of the Charges payable by OpCo for such Site).5.11 Any Strategic Site may be redesignated as a ‘standard’ Site and any ‘standard’ Site may be redesignated as a Strategic Site at any point during the Term by written agreement between the Parties.6. BUILD-TO-SUIT SITES AND EXISTING SITES6.1 Minimum commitment(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that new Build-to-Suit Sites and Existing Sites (together, "New Sites") will be operationalised by TowerCo during the Term, and that OpCo may use Space and capacity at any such New Site in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement by entering into a relevant LLA.(b) Subject to TowerCo’s confirmation that it can fulfil an Approved Rollout Plan strictly in accordance with the terms of Schedule 11 (Rollout Plans), during each of the first five (5) Contract Years of the MLA Term (each a "Relevant Year"), OpCo will commit to take Reserved Space (and may take Excess Space) on Ground Based Towers and Rooftop Towers at New Sites in no fewer a number than the lesser of:(i) the Annual Incremental Target; and(ii) whatever number is needed to achieve the Annual Cumulative Target,for each Relevant Year as set out at Schedule 4 (New Site Commitment) (the "Annual Commitment"). (c) If TowerCo refuses to accept any New Site Work Order (unless such refusal is in accordance with clause 6.4(b) or clause 6.4(c)) or the details specified in the New Site Work Order relating to the Target Completion Date and the Search Ring are outside the limits specified in Schedule 9 (New Site Ordering Process)), above:(i) such refusal shall constitute a breach of this Agreement by TowerCo since OpCo is expressly reliant on TowerCo to operate its business;(ii) the Annual Commitment shall be reduced by one (1) Site; (iii) if OpCo builds a mobile telecommunications site itself, or using the services of a Third Party, in place of the Site that TowerCo failed to provide, then, at OpCo’s option, TowerCo may be directed by OpCo in writing to provide O&M Services at such mobile telecommunications site (and the relevant Charges shall become payable);8 and(iv) at OpCo’s option, TowerCo will, at no cost to TowerCo, use reasonable endeavours to acquire the Head Lease of such mobile telecommunications site and the structural elements on its used for the purposes of installing telecommunications equipment at the prices paid by OpCo including the applicable Lease Fees to be paid by OpCo, following which such mobile telecommunications site shall be deemed to have become a Site for all purposes under this Agreement and can be used per the Agreement by other Tower Tenants (in default of which acquisition, the relevant site will be treated as a Retained Site for the purposes of this Agreement). 6.2 Obligation to offer co-location and other opportunities to OpCoUpon request by OpCo (and no more frequently than once per calendar month during the Term), TowerCo will provide OpCo with a comprehensive and current list of Sites which have the capacity to house OpCo Equipment, whether such Sites have existing tenants or not, and whether or not they are New Sites, or Sites already forming part of any Approved Rollout Plan (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the lists described in clause 9.12 and this clause 6.2 may be consolidated together).6.3 Right of first offer(a) If, at any time during the ROFO Period, OpCo requires the use of additional Build-to-Suit Sites beyond the commitments made by OpCo in an Approved Rollout Plan in fulfilment of the Annual Commitment, OpCo will offer TowerCo the opportunity to provide such further locations on a "right of first offer" basis, subject to separate commercial agreement in writing between the Parties in each case.(b) The "right of first offer" process referenced in clause 6.3(a) will follow the following process:(i) OpCo will issue a RFQ to TowerCo with details of the Build-to-Suit Site requirements (including whether such proposed Build-to-Suit Site is to be an On-Grid Site or an Off-Grid Site);(ii) if TowerCo wishes to supply the new Build-to-Suit Site, TowerCo will make a firm offer in response to the RFQ within the time period specified in the RFQ or any other time period agreed between the Parties in writing; and(iii) OpCo may accept or reject the offer, but may not accept an offer from a Third Party at an annual fee higher than TowerCo’s offer, if such Third Party would deliver the Build-to-Suit Site in a similar timescale and to a similar quality as TowerCo,(the "ROFO Process").(c) For the avoidance of doubt, OpCo will be under no obligation to abide by the ROFO Process beyond the expiry of the ROFO Period.(d) Any Dispute as to the application of the ROFO Process will be referred to Expert Determination for final settlement.(e) For the avoidance of doubt: (i) nothing in this clause 6.3 will prevent OpCo and TowerCo from agreeing a lower price for an Existing Site; and (ii) TowerCo’s obligation to provide O&M Services and, as determined by OpCo, other Services at any Site is not discharged by the fact that OpCo may have engaged a Third Party to construct such Site.6.4 Obligation to build and financial responsibility(a) If, at any time during the Term, OpCo requires TowerCo to construct a new Build-to-Suit Site or to make available Space at an Existing Site:(i) subject to clauses 4.4, 6.1(c) and 6.4(b), TowerCo will comply with such request and will be financially responsible for all associated costs (including construction costs and all the costs of acquiring any necessary interest in the land); and(ii) the process described at Schedule 9 (New Site Ordering Process) will apply.(b) If, in relation to a proposed new Build-to-Suit Site for a Ground Based Tower, TowerCo is able to demonstrate that the construction costs will be at least seventy-five percent (75%) more than the then-current Average GBT Construction Cost ("Construction Cost Threshold"), TowerCo may refuse, without the effects of clause 6.1(c)(i) applying, to comply with OpCo’s request pursuant to clause 6.4(a) unless OpCo agrees  in writing to pay fifty percent (50%) of the incremental construction costs over and above the Construction Cost Threshold.9(c) Any Dispute between the Parties as to whether, on a case by case basis, the Construction Cost Threshold has been or will be met will be referred to Expert Determination for final settlement.(d) Charges will be payable in respect of any New Site once Acceptance or Deemed Acceptance has occurred in respect of such New Site.(e) Acceptance in respect of a Site will be deemed to have occurred: (i) if the Site was transferred to TowerCo pursuant to the New Framework Agreement; (ii) if in accordance with section 5.1 of Schedule 9 (New Site Ordering Process), OpCo fails to proceed with the inspection of the Site within the Inspection Period or fails within five (5) Working Days following such Inspection Period to either issue a notice of Acceptance or Issues Notice to TowerCo; or (iii) if at any time after OpCo's receipt of an RFI Notice, OpCo accesses or occupies a Site for the purposes of installing and operating OpCo Equipment at the Site, then five (5) Working Days thereafter, ("Deemed Acceptance").7. PRE-EXISTING CO-LOCATION TENANTS7.1 If, as at the Effective Date, OpCo is under a pre-existing obligation (by contract, memorandum of understanding or other agreement with a Third Party) to provide Space at a Site to a Third Party ("Third Party Obligee"), OpCo will be entitled to: (i) lease Space at such Site in excess of the Reserved Space in order to satisfy such pre-existing obligation ("Additional Required Space"); and (ii) make available to such Third Party Obligee(s) the benefit of the Services, subject to payment to TowerCo of Excess Space Fees (in addition to the Base Rental Fees and other Charges), as necessary.7.2 All Space occupied by a Third Party Obligee is deemed to be Space occupied by OpCo for the purposes of payment of Base Rental Fees, Excess Space Fees and other Charges.7.3 TowerCo consents to the use of Additional Required Space by a Third Party Obligee in satisfaction of any pre-existing obligation owed by OpCo to any Third Party Obligee as envisaged under clause 7.1, provided that following the Effective Date and prior to the assumption of rights and obligations contemplated at clauses 7.4 or 7.5 below the Third Party Obligee must not use any Space at a Site not in use by the Third Party Obligee as at the Effective Date.7.4 OpCo may retain such Additional Required Space (and make it available for use by the relevant Third Party Obligee) until such time as:(a) TowerCo has a direct agreement in place with the relevant Third Party for occupation of the Space; or(b) the Third Party ceases to have need of the Space and therefore ceases its occupation of it,whereupon the relevant LLA will be deemed automatically amended to account for the fact that such Additional Required Space is no longer in occupation as between the Parties for the purposes of this Agreement and that any liability of OpCo in respect of the same has been discharged in full. 7.5 In respect of all Third Party Obligee arrangements for the use of Additional Required Space, with effect from the Effective Date, OpCo will:(a) use all reasonable endeavours and all contractual rights available to it in respect of such arrangement (including non-renewal and termination for convenience) to promptly novate the relevant third party agreement to TowerCo (or otherwise to facilitate the assumption by TowerCo of the benefit and burden of any non-contractual commitments owed by or in respect of such Third Party Obligee, such that TowerCo: (i) is paid directly by the Third Party Obligee for its use of the Additional Required Space; and (ii) assumes all obligations with respect to the same); and(b) until such time as such novation or other assumption of rights and obligations is effective, pass to TowerCo, subject to any necessary tax withholdings or other mandatory deductions, any monies received from such Third Party Obligee for its use of the Additional Required Space net of any reasonable costs incurred by OpCo on behalf of TowerCo in relation to the performance of the obligations owed to such Third Party Obligee but otherwise without set off or commission,and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Colocation Discount will apply upon any such novation or assumption of rights and obligations by TowerCo becoming effective but shall not apply before the novation or assumption of rights and obligations by TowerCo becoming effective.8.  ENERGY SUPPLY8.1 Power Classifications(a) Each Site’s Power Classification will be identified in the relevant LLA for such Site, and with respect to:(i) On-Grid Sites TowerCo will be responsible for establishing and maintaining physical connections to the power grid;(ii) Poor Grid Sites and Off-Grid Sites having a power rating of 60 kVA or less, TowerCo will be responsible for establishing and maintaining physical connections to the power grid and/or otherwise ensuring the supply of power to such Site; and(iii) Poor Grid Sites and Off-Grid Sites having a power rating of more than 60 kVA, OpCo will be responsible for establishing and maintaining physical connections to the power grid and/or otherwise ensuring the supply of power to such Site.(b) With respect to the procurement of power to any On-Grid Site or Poor Grid Site (including any New Site) via a contract with a relevant energy provider OpCo may either:(i) direct TowerCo to contract with a relevant energy provider for the supply of power to the Site; or(ii) contract directly with a relevant energy provider for the supply of power to the Site.(c) Notwithstanding any direction OpCo may have given TowerCo under clause 8.1(b)(i), at its option, OpCo may take responsibility for the supply of power to any Site upon written notice to TowerCo.(d) TowerCo will install individual submeters on all Sites for both OpCo and for any additional tenant in order to record and accurately differentiate their energy consumption.(e) The Lease Fees will not include the cost of electricity supplied by any utility company for OpCo Equipment (provided that, where the Head Lease includes power fees, no additional fees for power will be charged by TowerCo).(f) The cost of electricity supplied by any utility company for OpCo Equipment will be paid directly by OpCo provided that with regards to Sites that have:(i) outdoor cabinets, OpCo will bear the electricity cost of all OpCo Equipment inside such cabinets (whether passive equipment, active equipment and cooling systems); and(ii) indoor shelters with air conditioning units:(A) if OpCo is the sole tenant, OpCo will bear the cost of electricity for cooling inside such shelter and the cost of active OpCo Equipment; and(B) if there are multiple tenants, TowerCo will allocate the metered costs of cooling inside such shelter to tenants equally.(g) If determined by OpCo in accordance with clause 8.1(b) that:(i) TowerCo will be responsible for contracting with the relevant energy provider at any Site:(A) each Party will provide any assistance reasonably required by the other in order to manage such relationship;(B) it is agreed that TowerCo’s contract may be pursuant to a novation of an existing agreement between OpCo and such relevant energy provider;(C) TowerCo will continue to cooperate with OpCo’s reasonable instructions (including by acting as intermediary between OpCo and the relevant energy provider if required to do so by OpCo);(D) in all cases TowerCo will use reasonable endeavours to secure the most favourable commercial terms possible;(E) TowerCo will be invoiced directly by such energy provider for the supply of power to the relevant Site; and(F) OpCo will reimburse TowerCo for the costs of its metered consumption of power at such Site on a pass-through basis without mark-up or uplift of any kind applied.(ii) OpCo will be responsible for contracting with the relevant energy provider and any Site:(A) OpCo will be invoiced directly by the relevant energy provider for the power that it actually uses at such Site by reference to its metered kWh consumption of power; and(B) OpCo reserves the right to charge the other tenants on such Sites for their metered consumption of power.8.2 On-Grid Sites(a) Service Levels concerning power availability will not apply in respect of On-Grid Sites for which OpCo has directed TowerCo to contract with the relevant energy provider provided that the entire benefit of any service level agreements in place with a relevant energy provider has been made available to OpCo (including the entire benefit of any remedies obtained against such relevant energy provider (including service credits) pursuant to any such service level agreement).(b) In the event of a power outage at an On-Grid Site, TowerCo will promptly notify OpCo (indicating how long the power outage is reasonably expected to last), and if the power outage is expected to last for:(i) not more than twenty-four (24) hours TowerCo shall provide at TowerCo’s cost, a mobile diesel generator to the affected Site within four hours of such outage occurring; and(ii) more than twenty-four (24) hours, TowerCo shall provide a mobile diesel generator to the affected Site within four hours of such outage occurring provided that TowerCo may charge OpCo for the cost of such diesel fuel used by the generator during the outage.(c) If there is a power outage that affects more than [x]1011 On-Grid Sites (without mobile diesel generators) simultaneously, TowerCo will deploy up to [x]12 mobile diesel generators and OpCo will be permitted to deploy its own mobile diesel generators on the remainder of the Sites affected by the outage. For avoidance of doubt, TowerCo will not be liable to pay Service Credits in the event of such power outage. 8.3 Poor-Grid and Off-Grid Sites(a) Subject to clause 8.3(e) and unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, TowerCo will provide Energy Services in respect of Poor Grid Sites and Off-Grid Sites having a power rating of no more than 60 kVA, as identified in each relevant LLA ("Energy Services Sites").(b) Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, OpCo will be responsible for making its own arrangements to ensure the supply of power to Poor Grid Sites and Off-Grid Sites with a power rating of more than 60 kVA.(c) [For each Energy Services Site, in consideration of the performance by TowerCo of the Energy Services at such Site, OpCo will pay a monthly, flat rate charge for gensets up to 60 kVA in accordance with Schedule 2 (Charges) ("Energy Services Fee").] (d) The Energy Services Fee is inclusive of all energy systems capex, maintenance and ancillary costs (including the costs of repairs, spares and other consumables, and of fuel delivery and storage) which may be incurred by TowerCo in connection with its provision of the Energy Services, but excludes the cost of fuel itself (which will be separately chargeable to OpCo in accordance with clause 8.3(e), below).(e) OpCo will compensate TowerCo for the costs of fuelling Energy Services Sites by paying the Fuel Fee in respect of each such Site in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 17 (Fuel Fee Calculation).131415(f) Without limitation (and in addition) to clause 8.3(g), in any respect of any subsequently occurring Renewal Term, at any Energy Services Site, OpCo may terminate the Energy Services provided that:(i) OpCo provides no less than three (3) years' written notice to TowerCo. Such written notice may be served prior to the commencement of the subsequently occurring Renewal Term (such that the effective date of the termination of the Energy Services may be the date of the commencement of the subsequently occurring Renewal Term) or served at any time during the subsequently occurring Renewal Term;(ii) under this clause 8.3(f), OpCo may not terminate the Energy Services in respect of more than 17% of all Energy Services Sites in each of the following periods:(A) Contract Years 1 – 3 of the subsequently occurring Renewal Term;(B) Contract Years 4 – 6 of the subsequently occurring Renewal Term; or(C) Contract Years 7 – 9 of the subsequently occurring Renewal Term,16provided that there shall be no limitation on OpCo's right to terminate the Energy Services at any or all of the Energy Services Site, with effect from the expiry of Contract Year 10 of the subsequently occurring Renewal Term, subject to providing no less than three (3) years' written notice to TowerCo or such termination.17.(g) At any Energy Services Site which is an Energy Savings Site, OpCo may terminate the Energy Services upon three (3) months written notice to TowerCo (upon which any liability of OpCo to pay Energy Services Fees for that Energy Savings Site will cease), provided that OpCo: (i) may not terminate the Energy Services at any Energy Savings Site during the first four (4) Contract Years;(ii) may not terminate the Energy Services in respect of more than 17% of all Energy Savings Sites during the Initial Term; and(iii) in any subsequently occurring Renewal Term, may only, terminate the Energy Services in respect of a percentage of all Energy Savings Sites, such percentage calculated as:(duration of relevant Renewal Term / duration of Initial Term) * 17%.For example, if the relevant Renewal Term is 5 years, then the percentage amount will be 8.5%. (iv) 18provided also that OpCo may not: (v) terminate the Energy Services in respect of more than 8.5% of all such Energy Savings Sites in any one Contract Year during the Initial Term; or (vi) in any subsequently occurring Renewal Term, terminate the Energy Services in respect of a percentage of Energy Savings Sites, such percentage calculated as:19 (duration of relevant Renewal Term / duration of Initial Term) * 8.5%.For example, if the relevant Renewal Term is 5 years, then the percentage amount will be 4.25%. 8.4 Without prejudice to any of the foregoing, as required by OpCo, TowerCo will provide relevant Energy Services (including Fuel Services) to any or all of the Energy Service COW Sites.8.5 To ensure that Energy Service Sites have sufficient power capacity to meet OpCo’s evolving needs OpCo shall provide TowerCo with an annual forecast, updated quarterly of the Energy capacity per site. TowerCo shall indicate which Sites (if any) require upgrade to meet such capacity demand and TowerCo will then promptly perform the relevant upgrades in accordance with clause 4.7.20 9. RELOCATION AND CONSOLIDATIONRelocation9.1 OpCo may at its sole discretion Relocate up to five percent (5%) of the total Sites occupied by OpCo during each five (5) Contract Year period of the MLA Term to other Sites owned or operated by TowerCo ("Relocation Allowance") provided that:(a) Build-to-Suit Sites may not be included in the Relocation Allowance during the Initial Term applicable to any such Site;(b) in each case, the Site to which OpCo wants to Relocate contains available space, and OpCo shall use reasonable endeavours to ensure contiguous and efficient use of space at the Site at all times; (c) the cost of any Make Ready Works to be borne by TowerCo in respect of the Site to which OpCo wants to Relocate does not exceed the Make Ready Threshold, in which case clause 9.2 shall apply, provided always that TowerCo shall: (i) have acted diligently throughout to reduce such costs to a minimum and (ii) demonstrate such costs in writing to OpCo’s reasonable satisfaction;(d) OpCo has provided at least sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to TowerCo;(e) there is no reduction in the Lease Fees paid as a result of any such Relocation; and(f) the existing LLA is amended as necessary (i.e. not terminated in accordance with clause 23) except the duration of the existing LLA shall remain the same.9.2 If the Make Ready Threshold is exceeded OpCo shall be obliged to pay fifty percent (50%) of the incremental Make Ready Works costs over and above the Make Ready Threshold. Any Dispute between the Parties as to whether, on a case-by-case basis, the Make Ready Threshold has been or will be met will be referred to Expert Determination for final settlement.9.3 If the Relocation Allowance for any five (5) Contract Year period is not exhausted during the relevant period, the unused portion may not be carried over to the next five (5) Contract Year period.9.4 OpCo will bear any and all costs related to dismantling, Relocation and reinstallation of OpCo Equipment in connection with exercise of its right at clause 9.1. 9.5 Except as set out in clause 9.4 or 9.9, TowerCo will bear all costs (including OpCo's costs) of any substitution or Relocation of Sites.9.6 TowerCo may propose an alternative Site in substitution for the Site that OpCo proposes to Relocate to in connection with the exercise of its right at clause 9.1 (and OpCo will be at liberty to accept or reject such proposal).9.7 If, prior to the end of the relevant Term:(a) subject to clause 4.14, a Head Lease for a Site expires or terminates for any reason; or(b) as a result of the failure by TowerCo to secure or maintain any Permit required to be held by TowerCo for a Site materially and adversely impacts the use of the Site,then TowerCo must Relocate the Reserved Space and any Excess Space to an alternative Site (which is satisfactory to OpCo (acting reasonably) and meets the Consolidation Criteria) as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, and shall cover all OpCo’s costs associated with such Relocation.  Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the provisions of the relevant LLA will remain the same. 9.8 In the event of a Mandatory Relocation, TowerCo shall provide OpCo with no less than three (3) months’ notice prior to such Mandatory Relocation effective date. During such notice period, TowerCo must provide an alternative Site as soon as practicable. 9.9 In the event of a Mandatory Relocation, each Party shall bear its own respective costs and expenses relating to such Mandatory Relocation with OpCo bearing the costs related to the movement of OpCo Equipment, and TowerCo bearing all other costs.9.10 Where an existing Strategic Site is substituted in accordance with this clause 9, the new Site to which OpCo Relocates will automatically be designated as a Strategic Site.9.11 [If TowerCo wishes to conduct repairs, renovation work to any Site, Tower or Facility, which will require the temporary removal of OpCo Equipment for more than twelve (12) hours or otherwise impact the operation of OpCo’s RAN for more than twelve (12) hours, TowerCo shall use reasonable endeavours to provide OpCo at least prior written notice of such intention as set out in Schedule 1 (Services), paragraph 3. If the work requires the temporary removal of OpCo Equipment for more than twelve (120 hours, TowerCo will provide an alternative Facility the use of which will not cause the OpCo RAN to lose quality, capacity or coverage, and it will bear all related Relocation costs. The notice requirement may be expedited by OpCo or TowerCo (acting reasonably) if such repair, renovation or dismantling work is urgently needed for the structural integrity of a Tower.]9.12 In all cases of Relocation, other than in connection with OpCo’s exercise of the Relocation Allowance, to the extent that a Colocation Discount or Most Favoured Customer Discount applied at the old Site, then the higher of such discount (as applicable at the old Site) shall be deemed automatically and immediately to apply to the new Site.9.13 For the avoidance of doubt, in all cases of Relocation in connection with any Relocation occasioned by OpCo's exercise of the Relocation Allowance, no discount (i.e. the applicable Colocation Discount or Most Favoured Customer Discount) shall apply.2122Consolidation9.14 Upon request by OpCo (and no more frequently than once per calendar month during the Term), TowerCo will provide OpCo with a comprehensive and current list of its Sites with installed Facilities (apart from the Sites and Facilities already under occupation by OpCo) consistent with the Consolidation Criteria (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the lists described in clause 6.2 and this clause 9.11 may be consolidated together).9.15 Without prejudice to clause 9.11, TowerCo must, at least once in each Contract Year, report to OpCo on any opportunities it has identified in [any Region][the Territory]23 to Consolidate the number of Sites taken by the OpCo with those of or any Third Party (without adversely affecting coverage, capacity or reliability) (the “Consolidation Report").9.16 The Parties:(a) acknowledge that there may be benefit to both Parties in Consolidation at any time created as a result of the sharing of fixed costs payable on Sites (including Head Lease rates, energy costs and security costs) by multiple tenants (the benefits to TowerCo are in the form of reduced operating costs, whereas for the OpCo, benefits manifest as the Consolidation Discount or other discount pursuant to clause 9.17); and(b) agree to optimize the potential benefits of Consolidation at any time, while concurrently preserving the coverage and capacity of the OpCo and maintaining essential network nodes such as transmission hub Sites by reference, at minimum, to the Consolidation Criteria.9.17 [Consolidation Discounts shall apply commencing from the Consolidation Start Date, which shall be the earlier of the date:(a) four (4) years following the Effective Date;(b) TowerCo has procured access (by contract or by acquisition) to one or more portfolios of Sites from other MNOs or businesses engaged in constructing, owning and/or operating communications towers within the Territory; and(c) TowerCo possesses a number of Sites equal to thirty percent (30%) of the Acquisition Sites.2425]9.18 For a period of four (4) years after the Consolidation Start Date, Consolidation Sites to which the Colocation Discount does not apply shall attract a twenty percent (20%) discount of all Lease Fees, and after the fourth anniversary of the Consolidation Start Date such discount shall reduce to ten percent (10%) of all Lease Fees (the "Consolidation Discount").9.19 With respect to any ad hoc Consolidation by the Parties prior to the Consolidation Start Date such Consolidation Sites shall attract the Colocation Discount. For Consolidation Sites where the Colocation Discount already applies, the Colocation Discount will continue in respect of the Consolidated Site for the remainder of the relevant LLA Term and the Consolidation Discount will not apply.9.20 To maximize potential benefits from Consolidation the Parties agree:(a) upon reaching the Consolidation Start Date an independent Third Party with appropriate knowledge and experience ("Consolidation Consultant") shall be jointly appointed and funded to evaluate the impact of Consolidation on radio frequency coverage and capacity (the Parties will also seek other MNOs to join this mutual planning exercise);(b) the Consolidation Consultant:(i) will ensure technical assumptions regarding radio frequency coverage and capacity align with those of the OpCo and any other relevant MNOs;(ii) has a mandate that includes identifying scenarios that maximize synergies resulting from Consolidation; and(iii) will autonomously identify the Sites to be decommissioned, based on technical criteria specified in Part A and Part B of Schedule 14 (Consolidation Criteria) or any additional technical criteria mutually agreed upon by all Parties and create a plan setting out each of the requirements (the "Consolidation Plan").9.21 The Parties envisage that the Parties and the additional MNOs will enter into a legally binding agreement (or series of agreements) in which they each commit to use their respective reasonable endeavours to implement the Consolidation Plan.9.22 Each Party will (and will use reasonable endeavours to procure that each additional MNO will) not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its appointment of the Consolidation Consultant or agreement of each Consolidation Plan.9.23 In all cases of Consolidation, TowerCo shall be entitled to maintain: (i) the same total number of tenancies; and (ii) subject to the Consolidation Discount, the aggregate amount of Charges across Consolidated Sites, but reduce its aggregate fixed costs.9.24 Any Site to which OpCo Equipment is Consolidated shall be a "Consolidation Site" and all rights and obligations of OpCo under this Agreement which applied in respect of the previous Site shall apply to the Consolidation Site.9.25 TowerCo shall bear all costs of Consolidation.10. RETAINED SITE MANAGEMENT10.1 For certain Acquired Sites, identified as such in the relevant LLA ("Retained Sites"):(a) the Head Lease over the Site (as well as title or other interest in the Facilities and other fixed and movable assets) will not transfer to TowerCo;(b) TowerCo will provide the Services and manage the Site as if it were owned or leased by TowerCo directly (including by paying Head Lease fees to the applicable Head Lessor on behalf of OpCo); and(c) TowerCo will only be permitted to offer Space at a Retained Site to a Third Party if permitted to do so by the terms of the relevant Head Lease.10.2 OpCo agrees that the Charges will apply in respect of Retained Sites.10.3 OpCo will not interfere with TowerCo's management and use of the Site envisaged under clause 10.1.11. ACTIVE NETWORK SHARING11.1 Upon notification to TowerCo, in respect of any Site, OpCo may enter into one or more agreements for Active Network Sharing with other licensed MNOs having their own spectrum licence, including in respect of 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G capabilities and successor wireless communications technologies (but excluding National Roaming Agreements) ("ANS Right").11.2 The Base Rental Fees and Excess Space Fees payable in respect of any Site where OpCo Equipment is being actively shared pursuant to OpCo's exercise of the ANS Right will be subject to a percentage increase in accordance with Schedule 2 (Charges) ("Active Sharing Premium").11.3 For the avoidance of doubt, OpCo will be entitled to enter into National Roaming Agreements at its liberty and without incurring any liability to pay increased Charges.12. PERMITS AND REGULATORY AUTHORITY MATTERS12.1 Each Party will be responsible for securing and maintaining, at their own cost, all Permits they are required to hold pursuant to applicable Law save that, subject always to clause 9.7(b), with respect to Acquired Sites only, if prior to the Effective Date OpCo’s practice was different to this, then TowerCo shall be entitled to follow such practice.12.2 OpCo shall provide, and shall use reasonable endeavours to procure from third parties as required, in a timely manner, all reasonable assistance, reasonable information, reasonable documentation, reasonable access to premises and personnel, and such other items or actions as are reasonably requested by TowerCo, to facilitate the obtaining or maintaining of the relevant Permits by TowerCo.12.3 Subject to clause 12.1, TowerCo will ensure that its operations, its provision of the Services and each of the Sites and Facilities comply with all applicable Laws.12.4 In respect of BTS Sites, TowerCo shall have a period of up to three (3) months from the date such Site is Ready for Occupation (each a “BTS Grace Period”) to obtain and maintain Permits for such BTS Sites and during the BTS Grace Period, TowerCo will not be in breach of this Agreement to the extent that such breach arises as a result of the failure by TowerCo to obtain such Permits (including for the avoidance of doubt, a material breach under clause 23.1(a)(i)(A), provided TowerCo has used all reasonable endeavours to obtain such Permits.13. COMPLIANCE13.1 TowerCo will maintain in force throughout the Term, in a form reasonably satisfactory to OpCo, corporate policies designed to ensure compliance with all applicable Laws, Regulatory Authority recommendations and directives, and Good Industry Practice concerning (at a minimum):(a) construction materials and procedures;(b) physical security;(c) health and safety;(d) environmental, social and governance matters;(e) anti-bribery and anti-corruption (including all applicable Anti-Bribery Laws);(f) anti-modern slavery, anti-human-trafficking, and anti-child labour;(g) cybercrimes prevention and data protection;(h) risk and business continuity management; and(i) any other laws, standards, regulations and/or policies related to the scope of work of TowerCo,each a “Mandatory Policy” and together the “Mandatory Policies”.13.2 TowerCo will fully comply (and will procure that its Subcontractors fully comply) with the provisions of each of the Mandatory Policies at all times during the relevant Term.13.3 TowerCo will promptly notify OpCo upon becoming aware of any breach by it or any of its Subcontractors of any provision of a Mandatory Policy.13.4 TowerCo will make each such Mandatory Policy available for review by OpCo promptly upon request and, following any such review, will update each such Mandatory Policy in accordance with OpCo's reasonable instructions.14. CHARGES AND PAYMENT14.1 General(a) In consideration of TowerCo performing its obligations under this Agreement, OpCo will pay TowerCo the Charges in accordance with this clause 14 and calculated in accordance with Schedule 2 (Charges).(b) As applicable to:(i) the Services being performed at each Site; and(ii) the Space occupied by OpCo at each Facility,(and subject to the provisions of this Agreement and without prejudice to clauses [4.5(b), 4.8(c), 4.12(b), 4.14(c), 5.5, 9.2, 11.2, and 14.4]), OpCo will pay the following Charges:(A) Base Rental Fees;(B) Excess Space Fees;(C) O&M Fees;(D) Energy Services Fees; and(E) Fuel Fees;each as more fully described in Schedule 2 (Charges).(c) The Charges for each Site will be calculated separately but aggregated in one (1) monthly invoice relating to this Agreement and all LLA's (provided that each such invoice must be accompanied with a fully reconciled breakdown of the Charges which have been applied with respect to each Site) and issued in arrears. The first invoice in the form agreed between the Parties is set out in Schedule 2 (Charges).(d) For each Site, Charges will be payable from the earlier of: (i) the date of the relevant LLA; (ii) the date upon which Acceptance or Deemed Acceptance occurs; and (iii) five (5) days after OpCo has delivered OpCo Equipment at the Site as envisaged under clause 4.5.(e) All Charges will be payable in [currency of the relevant jurisdiction].(f) Subject to clauses 14.1(j) and 14.1(k), OpCo will pay TowerCo the Charges in arrears within forty-five (45) days of receipt of an itemised invoice (broken down on a Site by Site basis, with sufficient detail of any applicable Charges (as described in clause 14.1(b)) unless there is a Manifest Error with the invoice whereupon 14.1(j) applies.(g) If any Charges remain unpaid for:(i) at least forty-five (45) days following the date payment was due, TowerCo shall have the right to charge interest in accordance with clause 14.1(m) provided that if any of the Charges on which interest has been paid by OpCo later transpire to have been wrongly invoiced, then an amount equal to 200% of such interest shall become immediately payable to OpCo; and(ii) at least ninety (90) days following the payment due date of the invoice and such unpaid Charges amounting to or exceeding the Threshold Amount, TowerCo shall not be liable for Service Levels and Service Credits in relation to power availability and mean time to repair, and TowerCo will be relieved of any obligation to pay late delivery credits in Schedule 9 (New Site Ordering Process) at any Site until such time as OpCo makes payment of  all such unpaid Charges to TowerCo (and for the avoidance of doubt, relevant Service Levels and Service Credits which would otherwise have applied or accrued during such period of non-payment shall not apply or accrue) provided that if any such Charges later transpire to have been wrongly invoiced, then the relief from such liability shall be deemed not to have occurred.(h) If at any time OpCo has failed to pay undisputed Charges: (i) in aggregate equal to an amount greater than the Threshold Amount and (ii) which are due and payable under this Agreement or any LLA, and (iii) such Charges continue to remain unpaid ninety (90) days after TowerCo has provided OpCo with notice that such Charges have become overdue, TowerCo shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and all or any LLAs.(i) Payment by OpCo is without prejudice to any claims or rights which OpCo may have against TowerCo and will not constitute any acknowledgment by OpCo as to the proper performance by TowerCo of its obligations under this Agreement.(j) If OpCo, at all times acting reasonably and in good faith: (i) genuinely disputes the Service Credits component of an invoice (a "Service Credits Dispute"); or (ii) genuinely disputes any amount of the Charges invoiced (an "Invoice Error"), it will immediately notify TowerCo of the nature of the Service Credits Dispute or Invoice Error, giving all relevant details and referring the Service Credits Dispute or Invoice Error to the Dispute Resolution Procedure. Subject to clause 14.1(k), pending resolution of such Dispute, OpCo will be entitled to withhold payment of the disputed amount of the invoice (but TowerCo must continue to perform all the Services). (k) If any portion of an invoice is disputed by OpCo (but not the whole invoice) pursuant to clause 14.1(j), then if it has been presented in good faith by TowerCo, OpCo will pay the undisputed amount and the Parties will seek to resolve the Dispute for the other amount in accordance with clause 14.1(j), provided that OpCo will always pay to TowerCo minimum of (i) sixty-five percent (65%) of the Base Rental Fees described in such relevant invoice; or (ii) sixty-five percent (65%) of the Base Rental Fees described in the most recent undisputed invoice, whichever is lower, notwithstanding any amount disputed by OpCo pursuant to clause 14.1(j) save in the case of a Manifest Error whereby OpCo may, acting reasonably and in good faith, make any adjustment for the amount of the Manifest Error. (l) All amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement are exclusive of:(i) any VAT properly chargeable. OpCo will pay VAT at the rate for the time being properly chargeable in respect of the Services subject to TowerCo providing OpCo with such valid tax invoices or other documentation as may be required; and(ii) any mandatory withholdings as required by applicable Law.(m) In accordance with clause 14.1(g)(i), TowerCo may charge late payment fees on the late payment of any Charges as received under this Agreement which will accrue daily from the due date to the date of actual payment on any overdue amounts under this Agreement (whether before or after judgment) at the rate of [[ ] per annum ]above the [base rate] of the [central bank of the relevant jurisdiction] for the time being in force.] [Note to draft: for review by local counsel on a case by case basis in relation to each relevant jurisdiction.]14.2 Price CalculationsSubject to any price adjustments (as described in clause 14.3 and Schedule 2 (Charges)), the Charges for Base Rental Fees, Excess Space Fees, O&M Fees, Energy Service Fees and Fuel Fees for each Site will be calculated in accordance with Schedule 2 (Charges).14.3 Price Adjustments(a) The following price adjustments may have effect in respect of certain of the Charges, as more fully described in Schedule 2 (Charges):(i) Lease Fee Adjustments(A) On each anniversary of the Effective Date, the Base Rental Fees for each Site will be subject to a percentage adjustment equal to fifty percent (50%) of the lesser of: (i) Indexation or (ii) the CPI Cap (provided always that any such percentage adjustment will be no less than the CPI Collar).(B) On each anniversary of the Effective Date, the Excess Space Fees for each Site will be subject to a percentage adjustment equal to fifty percent (50%) of the lesser of: (i) Indexation;

Such termination may be in full (if the LLA relates only to one Site or if the LLA relates to multiple Sites and all such Sites are affected by the Force Majeure Event) or in part (if the LLA relates to multiple Sites, not all of which are affected by the Force Majeure Event (and then such termination shall relate only to Sites affected by the Force Majeure Event)). 30.7 If a Force Majeure Event is continuing and precludes TowerCo from performing its obligation to build a new site as required under Schedule 9 (New Site Ordering Process) for a period of more than one hundred and eighty (180) days: (i) TowerCo will not be obliged to perform such obligations to build a new site; and (ii) the Annual Commitment for the Relevant Year will be commensurately reduced by one. 30.8 If a Force Majeure Event precludes the Affected Party from performing its obligations at more than twenty percent (20%) of the Sites provided under this Agreement (including each LLA) for a period of more than one hundred and twenty (120) days, the other Party shall be entitled, without liability, to terminate this Agreement and each LLA upon immediate written notice to the Affected Party.31.

TowerCo shall ensure that such TowerCo Alterations are carried out in such a manner, and at such times within the periods described above (save for paragraph 3iii which will be for a period agreed from time to time between TowerCo and OpCo), so as to minimise as far as possible the level of disruption caused to the OpCo Equipment or the operation thereof, or to any other activities of OpCo. In case of emergency repairs, TowerCo shall provide as much notice to OpCo as reasonably practicable. OpCo agrees to cooperate with TowerCo to allow the TowerCo to carry out such maintenance or work, including making reasonable alterations to OpCo Equipment to accommodate alterations to the Facilities or ground space to the extent such actions would not negatively impact the use of such OpCo Equipment. Any disruption or downtime caused by TowerCo in respect of works, the duration and timing of which is agreed between TowerCo and OpCo and carried out in accordance with this paragraph shall not result in payment of any Service Credit in accordance with Schedule 3 (Service Levels and Service Credits).c. To limit downtime and disruption to OpCo, TowerCo may only undertake TowerCo Alterations which will result in downtime or disruption to OpCo Equipment or network on up to one percent (1%) of the Sites which are subject to this Agreement in any month unless (i) OpCo (in its sole discretion) consents to additional TowerCo Alterations; or (ii) TowerCo Alterations are to rectify an emergency at a Site and cannot be delayed due to network outage or safety concerns. 4. Securitya. At each Site, Security Services, including:i. basic physical security, including Site access procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorised access;ii. Site management and electronic surveillance; andiii. human guards at high risk Sites (as will be agreed between the Parties on a case by case basis and provided that human guards will continue to be deployed at any Site to which they were deployed immediately prior to the Effective Date).b.

Schedule 3 : SERVICE LEVELS AND SERVICE CREDITS1. Introduction1.1 The objectives of the Service Levels are to ensure that the Services are of a consistently high quality, delivered to time and budget and meet the requirements of OpCo.1.2 TowerCo will provide the Services so as to meet or exceed the Service Levels described in paragraphs 2 to 4 (inclusive) of this Schedule 3 (Service Levels and Service Credits).1.3 If the Service Levels are not achieved or if TowerCo otherwise fails to perform its obligations under the Agreement, then without prejudice to O’Co's rights under the Agreement or at Law, TowerCo will:1.3.1 investigate, assemble and preserve pertinent information with respect to the cause(s) of the problem;1.3.2 advise OpCo, as and to the extent reasonably requested by OpCo, of the status of remedial efforts being undertaken with respect to such problem;1.3.3 minimise the impact of and correct the problem and thereafter recommence performance in accordance with the Service Levels as soon as possible;1.3.4 take appropriate preventative measures so that the problem does not reoccur; and1.3.5 if related to health and safety concerns or a power failure, permit OpCo or its nominated representative to remedy the failure, has not done so within a reasonable time, in which case TowerCo will promptly reimburse OpCo for O’Co's out of pocket costs and expenses without mark-up or overheads reasonably incurred in doing so. 1.4 TowerCo acknowledges that its failure to meet a Service Level may have a material adverse impact on the business and operations of OpCo and will be remedied in accordance with paragraph 1.3 of this Schedule 3 (Service Levels and Service Credits).1.5 Where a sum is expressed to be payable as a Service Credit, the Parties acknowledge and agree that:1.5.1 such sums are intended as a price adjustment to reflect the actual quality of service provided to OpCo and do not represent an estimate of the loss or damage that may be suffered by OpCo in respect of the breach of the Service Level(s) which gave rise to the Service Credit; and1.5.2 the crediting of such sums is without prejudice to any entitlement OpCo may have under this Agreement or at Law (including but not limited to the right to claim damages from TowerCo relating to any loss arising from such failure to achieve the Service Levels).1.6 Service Credits are calculated pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Schedule 3 (Service Levels and Service Credits).1.7 TowerCo will provide and use monitoring tools and procedures as are reasonably necessary to measure and report upon its performance of the Services.1.8 TowerCo will provide OpCo with:1.8.1 real time access to all data used to monitor its achievement of the Service Levels; and1.8.2 sufficient information in order to ensure the levels of service that are being provided by TowerCo are in accordance with the Service Levels and so as to verify the Charges. TowerCo will provide OpCo with reasonable information for the purposes of such verification.1.9 TowerCo will provide OpCo with the details as to the levels of performance relevant to the Service Levels in writing on a monthly basis or as otherwise agreed in writing, together with all supporting information reasonably required by OpCo.1.10 TowerCo will be responsible for monitoring its performance against all of the Service Levels and will maintain adequate technical and organisational procedures and reasonable and auditable tools to enable it to do so. OpCo reserves the right to measure Towe’Co's performance. In the event of a discrepancy between Towe’Co's measurement and O’Co's measurement, O’Co's measurement will prevail except to the extent of Manifest Error.1.11 Service Levels measured on“a "time to perf”rm" basis will be measured from the time the relevant incident is:1.11.1 reported to TowerCo as measured by the date stamp of the incident in O’Co's problem management system interfacing to Towe’Co's problem management system; or1.11.2 discovered by TowerCo, whichever is earlier.1.12 TowerCo will create reports, trend analysis and such other information in a form similar to the template set out in Annex 1 to this Schedule below (as may be updated from time to time in accordance with OpCo’s reasonable instructions), to verify Towe’Co's performance and compliance against the Service Levels as soon as possible following the first day of each month (and in any event within five (5) Working Days thereafter) setting out performance against Service Levels during that month and on a cumulative average basis during the relevant Contract Year and will each month produce such a report for O’Co's information “a "Service Level Rep”rt").2. Access2.1 TowerCo will ensure ongoing access for OpCo without charge to each Site at the times specified for each S’te's Site Access Category, including for O’Co's Personnel in order to facilitate installation, maintenance and removal of OpCo Equipment.2.2 There are three (3) classes of Site, to which different access arrangements apply (as recorded in each relevant LLA“ ("Site Access Categor”es"):2.2.1 Secure Sites: Sites to which special and prohibitive access arrangements apply (which may include military, petrochemical or other nationally strategic Sites).2.2.2 Business Hours Sites: Sites not under the full control of TowerCo where the current Head Lease or Site owned permits access only during normal business hours.2.2.3 24x7 Sites: Sites under the full control of TowerCo and in respect of which, therefore, no restrictions on access apply (meaning acce‘s '24 ’ 7': sites fully under the control of TowerCo and which are therefore accessible twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week.36372.3 TowerCo will ensure that OpCo is able to access all Sites on a "twenty-four seven" basis, subject to any Third Party access restrictions imposed at Secure Sites and Business Hours Sites on a case by case basis.2.4 TowerCo will ensure that OpCo is able to access Business Hours Sites any time during normal business hours.2.5 In respect of all Business Hours Sites and 24x7 Sites, TowerCo will deploy, where reasonably practical, electronic locks and keys such that OpCo can obtain access without possession of a physical key.2.6 Subject to paragraph 1.2, above, TowerCo will provide a means to access each Site (e.g. by use of a one-time access code) to all relevant Personnel of OpCo (including contractors and nominated Third Parties for installation or maintenance purposes) within the following timeframes (where "Access Priority" is reasonably determined by OpCo and communicated to TowerCo on a case by case basis as the need for access to any such Site arises):Access PriorityMaximum Time to Provide AccessHigh30 minutesMedium60 minutesLow120 minutes3. Mean Time to Repair3.1 For avoidance of doubt, no service credits are applicable in respect of this Section 3. 3.2 At each relevant Site, TowerCo will use reasonable endeavours to repair failed components (other than those covered by paragraph 4 below) so as to meet or exceed the following Service Levels for mean time to repair ("MTTR"), where MTTR means, in each Measurement Period:Total corrective maintenance time for failures / Total number of failures3.3 There are three (3) categories of Site Maintenance Priority, as will be reasonably determined by OpCo and communicated to TowerCo on a case by case basis:3.3.1 High: ≤10% of Sites or ≤10% Energy Service Sites (as applicable)3.3.2 Medium: ≤30% of Sites or ≤30% of Energy Service Sites (but in each case greater than 10%) (as applicable)3.3.3 Low: all remaining Sites3.4 OpCo may, at its sole discretion and from time to time change the Maintenance Priority of any Sites, provided that OpCo provides no less than three (3) months' prior written notice of any such changed designation to TowerCo, and provided further that OpCo may not exercise such right under more than once in any given calendar year.3.5 The target Response Times, and MTTR (Temporary Solution) and MTTR (Permanent Solution) are as set out in the table below:SITE MAINTENANCE PRIORITYProblem SeverityHighMediumLowEmergencyResponse Time5 minutes5 minutes10 minutesTemporary Solution2 hours3 hours4 hoursEnduring Solution12 hours18 hours24 hoursMajorResponse Time5 minutes5 minutes10 minutesTemporary Solution12 hours18 hours24 hoursEnduring Solution1.5 days2 days3 daysMinorResponse Time15 minutes20 minutes30 minutesTemporary Solution2.5 days4 days5 daysEnduring Solution0.5 week1 week1 week3.6 Examples of relevant issues to which this Service Level relates (categorised by Problem Severity) and where OpCo can open a trouble ticket with TowerCo are as set out in the table below:PROBLEM SEVERITYEmergencyUtility grid provider shut off (including broken transformer)Power cable from utility grid provider to OpCo kWh meter and from kWh meter to panel distribution box inside the shelter is missing, cut or brokenFeeder or coaxial cable is missing, cut or brokenFacility or Site foundation is sunkLeakage on shelterEquipment vandalism or thievery which causes service to stopDamaged Tower or Facility (risk of collapse)MajorGrounding system or any of its part is broken or missingGrounding cable on utility grid provider pole is missing or brokenArrester on electrical wiring is missing or broken ("red" indicator occurs)Temperature inside the shelter is above twenty-five (25) degrees CelsiusTower light/lamp is brokenLighting on the top Tower is missing or brokenLighting inside the shelter is brokenAlarm door sensor is brokenDamaged Tower or Facility (no risk of collapse)Fence is missing or brokenDamaged door gateBroken lockMinorLandscape lighting for Site is brokenRusty padlock (if any)Site landscape is sunkGrass is tallDrainage is clogged upSite needs cleaning (grass rubbish poses fire risk)4. Power Availability4.1 Unless otherwise instructed by OpCo, TowerCo will provide an alternating current (AC) (or DC in respect of Off-Grid Sites) Energy Service to the Energy Services Sites.4.2 TowerCo will maintain AC Power Availability at the Baseline Level, meaning TowerCo is required to maintain at least the pre-existing level of performance observed during the twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Date ("Baselining Period"). The "Baseline Level" will be determined by measurements taken during the Baselining Period.4.3 TowerCo will improve the Power Availability annually in accordance with the 'Continuous Improvement' column below. The indicated percentage improvement is relative to the gap between current performance and ideal performance.4.4 OpCo and TowerCo may mutually agree levels of Power Availability that are higher than the Baseline Level and where OpCo will compensate TowerCo for the incremental capex required to achieve this higher level of performance. Any such capex should be based on fair market prices and will be pre-agreed with OpCo. Any dispute as to what constitutes a fair market price will be referred to Expert Determination for final resolution.4.5 At each relevant Site, TowerCo will provide the Energy Services so as to meet or exceed the Service Levels for power availability set out below (where "Site Maintenance Priority" is reasonably determined by OpCo and communicated to TowerCo on a case by case basis depending on the criticality of each such Energy Services Site to OpCo):Site Availability PriorityContinuous ImprovementHighMediumLowPower Availability (Territory Average)[TBD based on Baseline Level e.g. 99.99x%][TBD based on Baseline Level e.g. 99.xx%][TBD based on Baseline Level e.g. 99.xx%]1% each year for the first five (5) years following the Effective Date.• Power Availability (Per Site)98%97%95%N/A5. Service Credits385.1 Service Credits will apply for failure to maintain such a level in accordance with the "Service Level regime" section below.5.2 Service Levels will be subject to Service Credits on the basis of the following:5.2.1 Service Credits will payable upon any Service Level Default;5.2.2 Service Credit offsets are awarded for over-performance of Service Levels (subject to a max carry forward of three (3) months);5.2.3 The amount of Service Credit actually payable to OpCo with respect to all Service Level Defaults occurring in a single Measurement Period under the Agreement will not exceed, in total fifteen percent (15%) of the Charges for the Services due for the relevant Measurement Period ("At Risk Amount").5.2.4 In the event of a failure on the part of TowerCo, which results in a Service Failure affecting one or more dependent Site (for instance, the failure to provide power to a microwave hub Site supplying multiple dependent Sites, or to a Site integral to a sequential microwave site linkage) then Service Credits shall be payable for these affected dependent Sites. The amount of these Service Credits will be equivalent to those that would be due if the relevant Service Level had been directly breached at each individual dependent Site.5.2.5 Service Credits are calculated pro-rata to the magnitude of the failure to meet a Service Level. In this way, the amount between ideal operation and the Service Level is deemed the 'Allowable Gap' (e.g. a Service Level of ninety-nine percent (99%) has an Allowable Gap of one percent (1%)).5.2.6 Each Service Level has a Service Credit point value as shown in the table below.5.2.7 Failure to meet a Service Level yields that number of Service Credit points multiplied by the pro-rata multiplier (Actual Performance Gap – Allowable Gap)/Allowable Gap x Service Credit points) for that Service Level.(A) The “Allowable Gap” for a Service Level is the difference between perfect performance and the performance level specified in Table 1 (Service Credit Points) for such Service Level. (B) The “Performance Gap” is the difference between the performance level specified in Table 1 and the actual performance of TowerCo.  (C) The “Percentage Breach” is the Performance Gap divided by the Allowable Gap. (D) The “Service Credit Multiplier” is 1+ Percentage Breach.(E) The Service Credits due are calculated by reference to the Service Credit Points specified in Table 1 (Service Credit Points) multiplied by the Service Credit Multiplier.By way of worked example:• if the Service Level is 99% then the Allowable Gap is 1%; and• if actual performance is 98.9% then the Performance Gap is 0.1%; theno the Percentage Breach is 10% (0.1%/1%); ando the Service Credit Multiplier is 1.1x (1+10%); so where,• Service Credit points = 1000; and• Service Credits due = 1000 x 1.1 = 1100; and where• 1000 Service Credit points = 1% of Monthly fees; then• (subject to paragraph 5.2.3 above) discount to relevant Charges = 1.1% 5.2.8 One thousand (1,000) Service Credit points represent one percent (1%) of total Charges per Measurement Period.Table 1 – Service Credit PointsPriority LevelHighMediumLowAccess grant time (calculated per hour above the target)521Power Availability (Regional Average)1000500250Power Availability (Per Site)5020106. Service Credit Offsets 6.1.1 Supplier shall be awarded Service Credit Offsets for performance above target of any Service Level in respect of which Service Credits have been applied in the immediately preceding Measurement Period. The Supplier may use Service Credit Offsets to set off liabilities for Service Credits accrued due to under performance for other Service Levels.6.1.2 For the avoidance of doubt, OpCo will not make bonus payments to TowerCo due to over performance in respect of any Service Level.6.1.3 The Service Credit Offsets will be calculated based on a method that is symmetrical with the method for calculating Service Credits.  Specifically, Service Credit Offsets are awarded for the Performance Gap in excess of the Allowable Gap.6.1.4 The “Percentage Gain” is the Performance Gap divided by the Allowable Gap. 6.1.5 The “Service Credit Multiplier” is 1+ Percentage Gain. By way of worked example:• If the Service Level is 98%, then the Allowable Gap is 2 % (100% - 98%); and• If actual performance against such Service Level is 99 %, the absolute gap between actual performance and Service Level is 1% (99 % - 98%); thereforeo The Percentage Gain is 50% (1%/2%); and o The Service Credit Multiplier is 1.5x (1+50%); and where o Service Credits points allocated to this Service Level are 500; then o Service Credits expunged = 1000 x 150% (i.e. 1500 Service Credit points); meaningo Service Credit Offsets of 1.5% in respect of the relevant Charges to which Service Credits were applied in the immediately preceding Measurement Period. 7. Exemption from Service Credits7.1 TowerCo will not be in breach of this Agreement or liable to pay Service Credits for any delay that is directly attributable to any of the following:7.1.1 a Force Majeure Event provided the steps in clause 30.3 have been complied with;7.1.2 any breach by OpCo of a corresponding obligation under the Transitional Services Agreement;7.1.3 clause 14.1(g)(ii) applies;7.1.4 TowerCo Alterations provided that TowerCo shall have complied with the requirements of paragraph 3 above; 7.1.5 the actions or omissions of OpCo Personnel in breach of this Agreement;7.1.6 planned outage required by OpCo of the OpCo Equipment and/or software upgrades by OpCo;7.1.7 subject to paragraph 2.2 above;7.1.8 clause 8.2 applies;7.1.9 OpCo’s communications equipment outage for reasons not attributable to the TowerCo; or7.1.10 fibre outage for reasons not attributable to the TowerCo or the TowerCo’s passive equipment or Tower Facilities;8. Network Operations Centre8.1 Subject to clause 4.6(c)(iv) of this Agreement, TowerCo will establish and maintain during the Term a tower operations centre (the "TowerCo TOC"), operational at all times (twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week and three hundred and sixty-five (365) days in a year (three hundred and sixty-six (366) in a leap year)), with a dedicated hotline and email contact for use by OpCo to report faults at the Sites. TowerCo shall be responsible to connect, enable, and maintain at all times all the alarms related to Facilities and shall ensure that all such alarms are operational. OpCo shall provide TowerCo with links from OpCo's national network operations centre (the "OpCo NOC") to the TowerCo TOC to monitor alarm feeds.

Schedule 5 : NOT USEDSchedule 6 : BUSINESS CONTINUITY1. Introduction1.1 TowerCo will maintain in force throughout the Term a BCDR Plan in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this Schedule 6 (Business Continuity) and, in the event of a Disaster, will be responsible for invoking the BCDR Plan in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Schedule 6 (Business Continuity).1.2 Regardless of the occurrence of a Disaster or the invocation of the BCDR Plan, TowerCo will continue to use reasonable endeavours to provide the Services and to do so in accordance with all applicable Service Levels.2. Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan Structure2.1 In alignment with ISO 22301:2019 BCMS Standard, the BCDR Plan will detail the processes and arrangements which TowerCo will follow to ensure the continuity of the Services and the continuing operation of the Sites and Facilities following any Disaster.2.2 The BCDR Plan will be developed in such a way as to ensure recovery of all Services delivered by TowerCo to OpCo as soon as possible.3. Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan Updates3.1 Promptly upon request, TowerCo will provide OpCo with a copy of the BCDR Plan in order for OpCo to ascertain whether the BCDR Plan complies with the requirements of this Agreement or otherwise is reasonably acceptable to OpCo. OpCo will, within twenty (20) Working Days of receipt of the BCDR Plan, notify TowerCo of either its acceptance of the BCDR Plan, or, if it does not accept the BCDR Plan, of that fact and its reasons for finding the BCDR Plan unacceptable and any proposed amendments the BCDR Plan.3.2 Where OpCo notifies TowerCo pursuant to paragraph 3.1 that it does not accept the BCDR Plan, TowerCo will, within ten (10) Working Days, amend the BCDR Plan so as to take into account any amendments reasonably requested by OpCo, or otherwise required to render the BCDR Plan compliant with the requirements of the Agreement and reissue the amended BCDR Plan to OpCo, in which case the provisions of paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 of this Schedule 6 (Business Continuity) will reapply.3.3 TowerCo will, on annual basis and whenever one or more of the following occurs:3.3.1 TowerCo commences the provision of any new Services;3.3.2 the Services are otherwise modified such that the existing BCDR Plan is no longer sufficient to ensure continuity of the Services in the event of a Disaster; or3.3.3 a Regulatory Authority requests additional BCDR requirements,review and update the BCDR Plan within thirty (30) days and resubmit to OpCo for review and the provisions of paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 will apply to such updated BCDR Plan.4. BCDR Plan PrinciplesThe BCDR Plan will include, without limitation, and without prejudice to the terms of this appendix, the following:4.1 an outline of the systems and business processes required to ensure continuity of Services and the continuing operation of the Sites and Facilities (including prioritisation of these elements);4.2 details of how the invocation of any element of the BCDR Plan may impact upon the operation of the Services;4.3 business impact analysis and risk assessment;4.4 business continuity plans and procedures (including invocation, response, warning and communication and recovery)4.5 examples of invocation scenarios;4.6 details of who can invoke the BCDR Plan;4.7 detail regarding how the BCDR Plan links and interoperates with any overarching and/or connected disaster recovery or business continuity plans of OpCo and any of its other suppliers, as notified to TowerCo by OpCo from time to time;4.8 a description of how TowerCo will liaise with OpCo with respect to issues concerning business continuity and disaster recovery where applicable;4.9 crisis communication procedure to include close key contact details (including roles and responsibilities) for TowerCo (and any subcontractors or service providers) and for OpCo;4.10 a risk analysis;4.11 frequency of review and amendment of the BCDR Plan;4.12 a description of test procedures and frequency of testing;4.13 the procedures for reverting to “normal service”;4.14 a description of alternative processes, (including business processes), options and responsibilities that may be adopted in the event of a failure in or disruption to the delivery of the Services;4.15 a description of steps to be taken by TowerCo upon resumption of the Services in order to address any prevailing effect of the failure or disruption including a root cause analysis of the failure or disruption;4.16 details of the various possible levels of failures of or disruptions to services and the steps to be taken to remedy the differing levels of failure and disruption. The BCDR Plan will also clearly set out the conditions and/or circumstances under which escalation to the disaster recovery element of the plan is invoked;4.17 details of the procedures and processes to be put in place by TowerCo (and any subcontractor (or service providers) in relation to the Disaster recovery system and the provision of the disaster recovery services and any testing of the same;4.18 any applicable service levels with respect to the provision of disaster recovery services and details of any agreed relaxation of the Service Levels during any period of invocation of the BCDR Plan;4.19 the names and contact details of representative(s) designated by TowerCo and OpCo in paragraph 6 respectively, as amended from time to time;4.20 details of business continuity strategies to address the potential impact if TowerCo or any of its Subcontractors suffer an Insolvency Event; and4.21 political risk in TowerCo’s or Subcontractor’s jurisdiction and how these risks will be addressed and mitigated.5. TowerCo ResponsibilitiesIn addition to and without prejudice to its other obligations and responsibilities, TowerCo will:5.1 provide a representative who is knowledgeable in BCDR Plan creation and related planning activities and the actual BCDR Plan itself, so as to serve as a single point of contact for OpCo (“TowerCo BCDR Representative”);5.2 submit the BCDR Plan and any test results to OpCo representative appointed in accordance with paragraph 6.1, for review and acceptance; and5.3 remain fully responsible for any Subcontractors or service providers6. OpCo ResponsibilitiesOpCo will appoint a representative who is knowledgeable in business continuity planning to serve as a single point of contact for OpCo in respect of the BCDR matters (“OpCo BCDR Representative”) and who will:6.1 act as the primary interface to TowerCo’s business continuity representative appointed in accordance with paragraph 5.1;6.2 receive the BCDR Plan and test results and either submit comments to TowerCo’s business continuity representative or, when acceptable, provide signoff; and6.3 provide TowerCo’s BCDR Representative with OpCo updates to the BCDR Plan as required by this appendix.7. Invocation of the BCDR Plan7.1 TowerCo will notify OpCo immediately upon becoming aware of the occurrence of a Disaster or becoming aware that a Disaster is reasonably likely to occur.7.2 OpCo may require TowerCo to invoke the BCDR Plan when OpCo becomes aware of a Disaster or becomes aware that a Disaster is reasonably likely to occur.7.3 Subject to paragraph 8.4 of this Schedule 6 (Business Continuity), if a Disaster occurs or is reasonably likely to occur, each Party’s BCDR Representative (or if either representative is not available, a suitable alternative approved by OpCo) will promptly assess the situation and agree whether the BCDR Plan should be invoked. Where the parties are unable to agree, then OpCo’s decision as to:7.3.1 whether a Disaster has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur, and7.3.2 whether the BCDR Plan is to be invoked, will be final, and TowerCo will immediately follow such directions.7.4 If, due to the nature of the Disaster, it is impracticable or impossible for TowerCo to obtain OpCo approval before invoking the BCDR Plan (including where such approval would cause a delay in the invocation of the BCDR Plan that could pose a threat to OpCo or its business), TowerCo will invoke the BCDR without OpCo’s approval provided that OpCo will be notified of the invocation as soon as possible.7.5 TowerCo will use its best endeavours to ensure that OpCo is involved in all key decisions concerning the application of the BCDR Plan and the restoration of the Services, and will keep OpCo notified at all times of the progress and application of the BCDR Plan.8. Testing the BCDR Plan8.1 TowerCo will test the BCDR Plan on a regular basis (and in any event no less frequently than once every twelve (12) months). OpCo may require TowerCo to conduct additional tests of some or all aspects of the BCDR Plan at any time, where OpCo considers it reasonably necessary, including where there has been any change to Services provided or any underlying business processes, or on the occurrence of any event which may increase the likelihood of the need to implement the BCDR Plan. Except where an additional test relates to:8.1.1 a failure by TowerCo to implement successfully the BCDR Plan;8.1.2 a failure by TowerCo to comply with its obligations;8.1.3 an existing obligation of TowerCo; or8.1.4 any change proposed and made by TowerCo,OpCo will reimburse TowerCo for the reasonable costs incurred by TowerCo in conducting more than two (2) tests of the BCDR Plan per year.8.2 TowerCo will use its reasonable endeavours to ensure that any testing of the BCDR Plan will not impact the Service Levels or other operational activities unless such impact has first been notified to OpCo and OpCo nonetheless approved the performance testing.8.3 Following each test, TowerCo will send to OpCo a written report summarising the results of the testing and will implement any actions or remedial measures which the parties agree to be necessary as a result of those tests in accordance with a remediation plan.8.4 TowerCo will undertake and manage testing of the BCDR Plan in full consultation with OpCo and will liaise with OpCo in respect of the planning, performance, and review, of each test, and will comply with the reasonable requirements of OpCo in this regard.8.5 TowerCo will, at the request of OpCo, retest all or partial elements of the BCDR Plan if such BCDR testing fails or does not produce satisfactory results, as agreed between the parties.8.6 OpCo will have the right to inspect and audit (either by itself or through an external auditor) in accordance with clause 28 (Record Keeping, Audit and Inspection) of the Agreement any aspect of the BCDR Plan and TowerCo’s business continuity and disaster recovery processes. TowerCo will implement, at its own cost, any reasonable recommendations that may arise from any such audits as soon as reasonably practicable.Schedule 7 : PRO FORMA LLA

As soon as possible and in any event within five (5) Working Days following the end of the Inspection Period, OpCo, at all times acting reasonably and in good faith, shall either:5.3.1 notify TowerCo that the Site meets the Acceptance Criteria and such Site shall be considered Accepted; or5.3.2 notify TowerCo that the Site does not meet the Acceptance Criteria and deliver to TowerCo a written notice describing the deviations from the Acceptance Criteria (an “Issues Notice”). 5.4 Following receipt of an Issues Notice, TowerCo shall respond within ten (10) Working Days by either:5.4.1 carrying out all such works required to ensure that the deviations from the Acceptance Criteria identified in the Issues Notice are rectified and reperform the steps set out in this paragraph 5, or5.4.2 give notice to OpCo of any deviations from the Acceptance Criteria identified in the Issues Notice which it does not agree with, and the Parties shall resolve such disagreement in accordance with the Dispute Resolution Procedure in clause 41.5.5 If OpCo fails to proceed with the inspection within the Inspection Period or does not provide notice of Acceptance or an Issues Notice in accordance with paragraph 5.3 of this Schedule 9 (New Site Ordering Process), then, provided advance written notice was provided of the RFI Notice in accordance with paragraph 5.1 of this Schedule 9 (New Site Ordering Process) TowerCo shall provide notice of Deemed Acceptance to OpCo. Upon Acceptance or Deemed Acceptance, the Site shall be “Ready for Occupation” and TowerCo will issue to OpCo a notice informing OpCo of the same (the “Ready Notice”). Within forty-five (45) days of the issuance of the Ready Notice, the Parties will enter into a LLA with respect to the relevant Site and OpCo will have the right to start installing and operating OpCo Equipment at the Site in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.5.6 If no LLA has been entered into within forty-five (45) days of the issuance of the Ready Notice, such LLA will be deemed to have been entered into. 5.7 The following shall be the Acceptance Criteria for each BTS Site:5.7.1 the proposed BTS Site complies, other than for minor non-conformances, with the relevant New Site Work Order;5.7.2 the proposed BTS Site is connected to a permanent supply of uninterruptible electrical power; and5.7.3 TowerCo shall have acquired the Permits required for the construction and operation of the Tower for the proposed BTS Site. 6. New Sites Delivery Lead Time6.1 It is agreed that the Target Completion Date shall be achieved by TowerCo for every New Site subject to a New Site Work Order.6.2 Without prejudice to the application of any late delivery credits in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Schedule 9 (New Site Ordering Process) , if the Target Completion Date specified in a New Site Work Order requires a Site construction time that is greater than or equal to the relevant values set out in Table 2 for that type of Site, and TowerCo rejects such New Site Work Order, then the Annual Incremental Target for any Relevant Year (and the Annual Incremental Target in total) will be reduced by one (1) Site.Table 2AlgeriaGBTRooftopPrivate Landlord120 days90 daysGovernment Landlord180 days120 daysIraqGBTRooftopPrivate Landlord60 days21 daysGovernment Landlord235 days[x] daysKuwaitGBTRooftopPrivate Landlord75 days60 daysGovernment Landlord75 days60 daysOmanGBTRooftopPrivate Landlord270 days180 daysGovernment Landlord270 days[x] daysQatarGBTRooftopPrivate Landlord360 days21 daysGovernment Landlord420 daysN/ATunisiaGBTRooftopPrivate Landlord[x] days[x] daysGovernment Landlord[x] days[x] days7. Late Delivery7.1 If, after accepting a New Site Work Order, TowerCo is unable to make a Site Ready for Occupation by the applicable Target Completion Date, TowerCo will pay to OpCo late delivery credits equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the applicable monthly Charges for such Site for each full week of delay (after a grace period of fifteen (15) days), with a maximum late delivery credit of five (5) months of the applicable Charges for each Site, after which OpCo has the right to terminate the New Site Work Order with respect to such Site without incurring any liability.7.2 TowerCo will not be required to pay the late delivery credits above if the reasons for not being able to make a Site Ready for Occupation is directly attributable to any of the following7.2.1 a Force Majeure Event, provided the steps in clause 30.3 have been complied with;7.2.2 any breach by OpCo of a corresponding obligation under the Transitional Services Agreement;7.2.3 clause 14.1(g)(ii) applies;7.2.4 the actions or omissions of OpCo Personnel in breach of this Agreement.

For example, 1.2 will be rounded down to 1 and 1.6 will be rounded up to 2.
Schedule 12 : CALCULATION OF TOWER SPACECalculation of the Tower Space, utilized in the definition of reserved space on tower or excess space on tower is expressed in terms of normalized Effective Projected Area (EPA)Where Effective Projected Area (“EPA”) is equal to the sum of:(1) the EPA of the RF antenna system (comprised of the ensemble of discrete appurtenances such as RF panels, remote radio units, filters, diplexers and comparable equipment, exclusion of mounting frames, RF jumpers, coaxial, power and fibre optic cables) calculated using the latest revision of the ANSI/TIA-222 standards (“Structural Standard for Antenna Supporting Structures, Antennas and Small Wind Turbine Support Structures”); and(2) the EPA of the MW dishes calculated using the maximum value of the wind force coefficient Ca for the specific type and shape of radome as specified in Annexure C of the latest ANSI/TIA-222 standards (“Structural Standard for Antenna Supporting Structures, Antennas and Small Wind Turbine Support Structures”):EPAMWn = MAX[Ca(θ) x An]Where An is the outside aperture area of the nth microwave antennaThe EPA for a specific Site shall be expressed in terms of square meters and nominal height, where nominal height refers to:• For ‘greenfield’ Sites: the height of the supporting structure (measured in meters, from its base) minus 5 meters• For rooftop Sites: supporting structure highest point from AGL minus 2.5 metersThe nominal height is set at closing date and will not be modified for the duration of the agreement (i.e. tower extension, new structure )For example, EPA = 10m²@40mTo account for MW or RF Antenna Systems installed at different heights, the following "normalization formula" shall apply:Where:• EPAi is the EPA of the ith MW or Antenna System• hi is the height of installation of the ith MW or Antenna System• H is the nominal heightFor example, if:Tower height = 65m → nominal height (H) = 60mMW dish:EPA1 = 1.21 m² – height of installation: h1 = 60mRF Antenna System:EPA2 = 5.00 m² – height of installation: h2 = 30mEPA = EPA1 + EPA2        = 1.21 x  + 5.00 x        = 1.21 + 2.50        = 3.72 m²

Evidence, reasonably satisfactory to OpCo (based on radio frequency testing undertaken by the OpCo), that the proposed Consolidation Site will:(A)	enable OpCo to provide substantially the same or better capacity and coverage of its communication services as provided by it from the Site from which its OpCo Equipment is proposed to be Relocated; and(B)	not lead to any increase in Charges for OpCo as compared to the Site from which the OpCo Equipment is proposed to be Relocated,in each case, in the opinion of the OpCo acting reasonably (and for the avoidance of doubt, OpCo may make such assessment as to capacity and coverage based on its end users’ experience rather than simply in terms of engineering or technical parameters). 2. Evidence, reasonably satisfactory to OpCo, that the proposed Consolidation Site has substantially equal or superior qualities to the Site from which OpCo Equipment is proposed to be relocated in the following respects:(A)	tower height;(B)	wind loading capability;(C)	build quality and specifications;(D)	the ability for OpCo to expand on the Facility within its Reserved Space without requiring further material expenditure or strengthening of such Facility;(E)	the existence of grid connectivity and/or power solutions;(F)	LOSes (Lines of Sight) between the new site and current connected sites can be preserved or replaced with similar;(G)	optical fibre connectivity can be implemented on the new location with minimal effort and at materially the same cost as at the Site from which the OpCo Equipment is to be moved. In the event that OpCo agrees to Consolidate (or Relocate) its Equipment from a Site with fibre connectivity to one without fibre connectivity, TowerCo shall provide the local fibre drop from the old Site to the new Site at its sole cost and expense; (H)	Site Access arrangements. Part B 1. Opex saving: The Consolidation should whenever possible favour the Consolidation Site if it has lower opex (mainly, but not limited to, ground-lease and security).2. Required capex: The Consolidation should whenever possible favour the Consolidation Site if it has lower capex requirements considering factors such as (but not limited to) tower height, dismantling and relocation cost, upgrade cost and presence and relocation of additional Third Party tenants.3. Re-usage and re-deployment potential: The Consolidation should whenever possible favour the dismantling of structures for which the re-deployment potential of the dismantled structure would be higher, considering factors such as (but not limited to) tower age and tower condition.4. Future colo potential: The Consolidation should whenever possible favour the Consolidation Site if the future colocation potential for a third MNO would be greater, considering factors such as (but not limited to) location attractiveness / uniqueness, tower height, free space and overall structural strength.5. Additional site benefits: The Consolidation should whenever possible favour the Consolidation Site if it has additional benefits to a MNO and/or potential sources of revenues for the TowerCo, such as (but not limited to) fibre access and advertisement potential.6. New site construction: Any plans that would require TowerCo to construct a new site at an intermediate location between the existing sites of two operators to move the operators onto would not be considered a Consolidation Site opportunity unless agreed by TowerCo for purposes of this analysis.Schedule 15 : FAIR MARKET VALUE DETERMINATION1. Where the provisions of this Schedule 15 (Fair Market Value Determination) apply, each of TowerCo and OpCo shall engage one independent investment banking firm of recognized international standing experienced in the valuation of companies in the business of the development, leasing and management of communications towers for wireless service providers ("Independent Appraisers"). If any Party fails to engage an Independent Appraiser within ten (10) Working Days of the date of the exercise of the Buy Back Right in accordance with clause 24.2, it shall forfeit its right to appoint an Independent Appraiser and the Fair Market Value of the Buy-Back Assets shall be determined by the engaged Independent Appraiser.2. To enable the Independent Appraisers to conduct the valuation of the Buy-Back Assets, each of TowerCo and OpCo shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Independent Appraisers such information as the Independent Appraisers may request (to the extent in the possession of such Party or any of its Affiliates), including information regarding the business of TowerCo and its assets, properties, financial condition, earnings and prospects.3. If the determinations of the Fair Market Value for the Buy-Back Assets prepared by each Independent Appraiser do not differ by more than ten percent (10%), the Fair Market Value of the Buy-Back Assets shall be equal to the average of such determinations.4. If the determinations of Fair Market Value of the Buy-Back Assets by the two Independent Appraisers differ by more than ten percent (10%), then the Fair Market Value of the Buy-Back Assets shall be determined by an additional expert, reasonably acceptable to TowerCo and OpCo, provided that if the Fair Market Value of the Buy-Back Assets, as determined by such additional expert, is outside the range of the determinations of Fair Market Value of the Buy-Back Assets as determined by the two original Independent Appraisers, then the Fair Market Value of the Buy-Back Assets shall be the average of the determination of the additional expert and the determination of the original Independent Appraiser that is closest to the determination of the additional expert. If Tower Co and OpCo cannot agree on an additional expert within fifteen (15) Working Days of receiving the first determinations of the original two Independent Appraisers, then the dispute in respect of the selection of the additional expert shall be referred to Expert Determination.5. The determination of the Independent Appraisers and, if applicable, the additional expert in accordance with this Schedule 15 (Fair Market Value Determination) will be final, binding and conclusive on TowerCo and OpCo except in the case of fraud or Manifest Error. No Party shall seek recourse to courts, other tribunals or otherwise in connection with any determination of the Independent Appraisers or additional expert (if applicable), other than as provided in paragraph 4 in respect of the selection of the additional expert. Judgment may be entered to enforce the determinations made by the Independent Appraisers and additional expert (if applicable) in accordance with this Schedule 15 (Fair Market Value Determination) in any court having jurisdiction over the Party against which such determination is to be enforced.6. Each Party shall pay one-half of the expenses of the expert determination procedure incurred hereunder.7. The Fair Market Value of the Buy-Back Assets, whether determined by OpCo and TowerCo or the Independent Appraisers and/or additional expert, will assume an arms-length transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller with neither Party being under any pressure to sell, that the business is a going concern, on a debt and cash free and normalised working capital basis and be based on a range of valuation methodologies including acquisition multiples paid in the EMEA towerco industry, trading multiples of listed EMEA towercos and discounted cash flow analysis based on TowerCo's most recent business plan, including the following parameters:(a) the present value of any future revenue streams from such Buy-Back Assets (including rent and other amounts that would have been payable OpCo, other tenants and any other Third Party that is paying rent and other amounts, in respect of such Buy-Back Assets) assuming that all revenue paying leases are renewed upon expiration and excluding any liability from any events that initiated the sale of the Buy-Back Assets; (b) future increases in tenancies on the Buy-Back Assets based on historical experience; (c) the price adjustments in clause 14.3(a)(i)(A) and 14.3(a)(i)(B); (d) normalised Service Credits; (e) an assumed annual escalation of expenses to be incurred based on historical experience; and(f) discount rates applied to the cash flows of similar assets as implicit in publicly traded tower companies however there shall be no discounts for the portfolio size or condition or any other matters relating to the Sites or either Party's interests in the Sites.

If at any time either Party wishes to propose a Change, it may do so only by requesting the Change in accordance with the Change Monitoring Procedure set out in this Schedule.2. Until a Change has been made in accordance with the Change Monitoring Procedure, each Party shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing, continue to perform their obligations under this Agreement as if the request for a Change had not been made.3. Discussion between OpCo and TowerCo concerning a proposed Change shall result in any one of the following:(g) no further action being taken; or(h) a Change being implemented in accordance with the Change Monitoring Procedure.4. Any discussion which may take place between the Parties in connection with a Change Request before the proposed Change is implemented shall be without prejudice to the rights of the parties.Change Monitoring Procedure5. OpCo or TowerCo may make a Change Request by submitting the form set out as [Appendix 1] to this Schedule to the other Party.6. Where OpCo submits the Change Request, TowerCo shall evaluate the Change Request and shall provide to OpCo, no later than 5 days following receipt of the Change Request, an Evaluation Report which shall include the following:(i) TowerCo's assessment of the feasibility of the proposed Change;(j) the likely impact of the Change on the Services including any changes to the Service Levels or any other part of this Agreement;(k) resource requirements;(l) likely implementation date for the proposed Change and associated milestones where appropriate; and(m) any alteration to the Charges as a result of the proposed Change, including the reasons for any such alteration.7. Where TowerCo makes a Change Request under paragraph 5 TowerCo shall provide an Evaluation Report to OpCo in accordance with paragraph 6 above at the same time as the Change Request.8. OpCo will notify TowerCo in writing within 21 days of receipt of the Evaluation Report as to whether it:(a) requires TowerCo to proceed with the Change, in which case both OpCo and TowerCo shall confirm acceptance of the Change by signing the Change Request form and the Change shall be implemented in accordance with the Agreement; or(b) does not require the Change to be implemented (or, where a Change Request has been raised by TowerCo, does not consent to such Change), in which case the Parties shall continue to perform their obligations and the Services shall continue to be provided in accordance with this Agreement as if the Change Request had not been made; or(c) requires further information, in which case TowerCo shall provide such further information within 7 days of OpCo's request, following which OpCo shall either require TowerCo to proceed with the Change or notify TowerCo that it does not require the Change to be implemented.9. If a Change is accepted, then TowerCo shall implement the Change in accordance with the timescales and costings specified in the Change Request Form and Evaluation Report.Costs10. Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing by the parties, each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred in complying with this Change Monitoring Procedure (including, in the case of TowerCo, the preparation of Evaluation Reports).Administration and Change Register11. TowerCo will be responsible for the overall management, recording (also including updating existing records) and tracking of the Changes. OpCo will be kept fully informed by TowerCo and will be actively involved in the Change Monitoring Procedure.12. TowerCo shall keep and maintain a register, (the "Change Log"), recording all the Changes made under the Change Monitoring Procedure. The Change Log shall be available to OpCo at any time upon request.]
Schedule 17 : FUEL FEE CALCULATION40411. Introduction1.1 TowerCo will be responsible for fuelling each Energy Services Site. 1.2 At each such Site and in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule 17, OpCo will pay TowerCo a fee based on the diesel it consumes and designed to: (i) offset TowerCo's direct expenditure on diesel fuel; (ii) incentivise TowerCo to invest in extra fuel-efficient systems (which will ultimately diminish the fuel expenditure borne by OpCo); and (iii) ultimately share the benefit of relevant accrued savings (“Fuel Fee”).2. Poor-Grid and Off-Grid Sites: Energy Savings Agreement2.1 At its own cost and starting at the Effective Date42, TowerCo will install both an energy savings solution (including, but not limited to, cabinets, deep cycle batteries, rectifiers and hybrid controllers) which is designed to minimize the consumption of diesel fuel (a "Hybrid System") and a remote monitoring system to measure among other site parameters fuel and electricity consumption (the "RMS") at each of the Energy Services Sites, in accordance with the following schedule:By the end of each of the first four (4) Contract Years, TowerCo shall install Hybrid Systems and RMS at a minimum proportion of the total Energy Services Sites as follows:(a) by the end of the first Contract Year: 15% of the total Acquired Sites which are Energy Services Sites’(b) by the end of the second Contract Year: 50% of the total Acquired Sites which are Energy Services Sites;(c) by the end of the third Contract Year: 90% of the total Acquired Sites which are Energy Services Sites; and(d) by the end of the fourth Contract Year: 100% of the total Acquired Sites which are Energy Services Sites.2.2 Upon the completion of the conversion of an Energy Service Site to the Hybrid System the relevant Site shall in addition to being an Energy Services Site also be an "Energy Savings Site". Upon each relevant Site becoming an Energy Savings Site the [benefit sharing] principles set out below shall apply. At each Energy Savings Site TowerCo will be responsible for providing DC power to OpCo and OpCo will compensate TowerCo by paying a monthly DC services fee (the "DC Fee") which the Parties shall, acting reasonably and in good faith, attempt to agree (together with applicable, absolute SLAs) prior to the relevant Energy Services Site becoming an Energy Savings Site, based on the fair cost of the eliminated replacement capex of a DC power system for the relevant Site based on its maximum power load (rectifier and lead acid batteries). The parties agree to be reasonable in estimations, agree that this saving is not zero and will be adjusted based on changes in the OpCo power load required at the Site. If the Parties have been unable to agree the DC Fee for an applicable Energy Services Site prior to it becoming an Energy Savings Site, the Dispute will be referred to Expert Determination for final resolution).432.3 Until such time as an Energy Service Site is converted to the Hybrid System (and the relevant Site also becomes an Energy Savings Site), OpCo shall pay to TowerCo a monthly amount equal to the actual litres of diesel fuel consumed on such Site, multiplied by the [Reference Diesel Cost] during the relevant month. 3. FUEL FEE3.1 The Average Daily Grid Outage Hours is subject to a minimum of three (3) hours.3.2 The [Reference Diesel Cost] will be adjusted monthly based on [an index linked to global diesel prices]44,45 and [such index] will be set to a value of one (1) on the Effective Date. If global diesel prices:3.2.1 rise by 5% in the following month, then the [Reference Diesel Cost] will be indexed by 1.05x; and3.2.2 fall by 5%, the [Reference Diesel Cost] will be indexed by 0.95x.3.3 4647The Fuel Fee is calculated separately on per Site basis for: (i) Poor Grid Sites; and (ii) Off-Grid Sites.3.4 An annual revision of the Fuel Fee will be conducted based on mutual agreement, informed by the average of the most recent data taken from the past twelve (12) months from the Remote Monitoring Systems deployed by the TowerCo (provided that if the Parties have been unable to agree such revision within thirty (30) days of commencement of the relevant Contract Year, the Dispute will be referred to Expert Determination for final resolution). 3.5 In order to verify the accuracy of the Fuel Fees levied at each relevant Site, TowerCo will promptly upon request, provide OpCo with all data collected by the RMS related to fuel usage and grid outage time ("Fuel Fee Audit").3.6 If a Fuel Fee Audit reveals that OpCo has overpaid Fuel Fees at any Site, TowerCo will promptly (and within thirty (30) days of demand) refund such overpaid amounts.4. ENERGY SAVING MECHANISM4.1 Upon the completion of the conversion of an Energy Services Site to an Energy Savings Site (and for the purpose of offsetting the TowerCo's direct expenditures on diesel fuel consumption and rewarding the TowerCo for investment in extra fuel-efficient systems, which ultimately diminish the fuel expenditure borne by OpCo), the monthly Fuel Fee for an Energy Savings Site shall be calculated as:4.1.1 Diesel Used per Outage Hour multiplied by the reference diesel cost per litre multiplied by the Average Daily Grid Outage Hours (which may never be less than three (3)) multiplied by the days in the monthly billing period; [plus4.1.2 a share of the net benefit ("Net Benefit"), being 50% of:(A) (the Diesel per Litre Savings multiplied by the Reference Diesel Cost per litre multiplied by the Average Daily Grid Outage Hours (which may never be less than three (3)) multiplied by the days in the monthly billing period; 		less:(B) Monthly Increase in Grid Cost that is attributable to the charging of the LI batteries in the installed Hybrid System.48]4.2 For the purpose of the above calculation:Actual Diesel Usage: diesel used during Fuel Savings Measurement Period.Actual Grid Electric Usage per Day: KWh of grid electricity used during the Fuel Savings Measurement Period/ number of Days in Measurement Period.Adjusted Daily Grid Usage: Actual Grid Electric Usage per Day divided by the Adjustment Factor.Adjustment Factor: average daily hours of grid availability during the Fuel Savings Measurement Period/24.Average Daily Grid Outage Hours: as defined in paragraph 3.4 below.Baseline Adjustment Factor: average daily hours of grid availability during the Baseline Grid Electricity Use Period/24.Baseline Fuel Usage Per Day:   the total fuel usage during the Baseline Fuel Use Period divided by 365.Baseline Fuel Usage per Outage Hour:  the Baseline Fuel Usage Per Day divided by the Baseline Grid Outage Hours per Day.Baseline Fuel Use Period:  12 months prior to conversion of Energy Services Site to Hybrid System.Baseline Grid Electricity Use per Day: Baseline Net Grid Electricity Use Per Day divided by the Baseline Adjustment Factor.Baseline Grid Electricity Use Period: The month prior to conversion of Energy Services Site to Hybrid System (or the nearest period for which there is a bill from the local electricity supplier).Baseline Grid Outage Hours per Day: the average daily grid outage hours during the Baseline Fuel Use Period.Baseline Net Grid Electricity Use Per Day: the KWh of electricity used in Baseline Grid Electricity Use Period as taken from the electricity meter (or the RMS if available) divided by the number of days in the Baseline Grid Electricity Use Period.Diesel per Litre Savings: Baseline Fuel Usage Per Outage Hour less Diesel Used per Outage HourDiesel Used per Outage Hour: Actual Diesel Usage during the Fuel Savings Measurement Period/total Grid Outage Hours during Fuel Savings Measurement Period.Fuel Savings Measurement Period: the month following conversion of Energy Services Site to Hybrid System.Grid Outage Hour: the amount of time measured in hours that the electricity grid is not providing power to a Site during the relevant period.Grid Outage Hours per Day: average daily Grid Outage Hours during the Fuel Savings Measurement Period.Increase in Gross Grid Usage per Day: Adjusted Daily Grid Usage less Baseline Grid Electricity Use per day.Monthly Increase in Grid Cost: Normalized Increase in Grid Electricity Usage per Day multiplied by the Number of Days in the relevant month multiplied by the Price per KWh charged by the electricity provider in the month.Normalized Increase in Grid Electricity Usage per Day: Increase in Gross Grid Usage per Day multiplied by the Baseline Adjustment Factor.Reference Diesel Cost: [●].494.3 The Net Benefit (defined above) is calculated and fixed annually, and revised annually based on the latest 12 months of actual data. For the avoidance of doubt when the annual revision of the Fuel Fee is calculated the Baseline Fuel Usage per Outage Hour does not change from the original calculations.4.4 The Fuel Fee is charged on a per Grid Outage Hour basis.4.5 Grid Outage Hours are calculated on an average daily basis for each site in [a Region][the Territory] for the [relevant measurement period]50, the Regions are listed in Annex 1 to this Schedule 17. The Average Daily Grid Outage Hours in a month as calculated for a Region are applied to every Site in the Region and is subject to the minimum of 3 hours in paragraph 2.2 of Schedule 17  (Fuel Fee Calculation) above.5. RELOCATION OF ENERGY SAVINGS SITES5.1 OpCo has unlimited relocation rights in relation to Hybrid Equipment at Energy Savings Sites provided: OpCo relocates the equipment to like-for-like Sites provided sharing benefit per outage hour for the relocated equipment is not reduced due to the relocation and OpCo pays for all costs of relocating equipment to like-for-like Sites51 at which time the Site from which Hybrid Equipment was moved ceases to be an Energy Savings Site and the energy saving obligation and the supply of DC services of TowerCo stops and the Site to which the Hybrid Equipment was moved to becomes an Energy Savings Site.525.2 The Parties agree that:5.2.1 during the first four (4) Contract Years, TowerCo's obligations to convert the number of Energy Services Sites to Energy Savings Sites as specified in this Agreement shall be reduced by the number of Relocations implemented during such first four (4) Contract Years by OpCo from an Energy Services Site to a Site which is not an Energy Services Site; and5.2.2 TowerCo's obligations to convert the number of Energy Services Sites to Energy Savings Sites as specified in this Agreement shall be reduced by the number of Energy Services Sites at which OpCo terminates the Energy Services in accordance with clause 8.3(f) of this Agreement.531 DLA note: contents page / numbering to be updated in due course (auto x-refs to be reinstated etc.)2 Note to HSF: cross-references deleted as these don’t quite make sense and are unnecessary.3 To be removed once we have received confirmation that this is dealt with in the working capital adjustment in the completion statement (via the accounting policies being worked on by EY) (as per OG's comments).4 DLA note: this is a matter that should be specific to Iraq. Will be dealt with in the Iraq rider. 5 DLA note: check use of Agreement and Term thoroughly, as it seems a little confusing as amended6 HSF Note: to clarify, this is not about resolving disputes over "interpreting" the Agreement or amendments to the material legal provisions. It's for the purpose of dealing with changes to routine commercial and operational details that don't justify an amendment to the agreement, and which would be more conveniently dealt with via this mechanism. As discussed, happy to consider incorporating this mechanism into the Joint Management Committee  Mechanism.7 	To be set out in country riders.8 	Subject to opex threshold discussions for Oman and Algeria riders, which will apply in (i) difficult mountainous terrain (ii) in absence of colocation [HSF Note: As flagged, TowerCo reserves the right to revisit this in the Oman process, including inclusion of Oman Oil Company territory.]9 Subject to opex threshold discussions for Oman and Algeria riders. [HSF Note: As flagged, TowerCo reserves the right to revisit this in the Oman process, including inclusion of Oman Oil Company territory.]10 	Toyota to confirm.11 DLA note: parties to agree on number. 50 suggested by Toyota. 12 	To be set out in country riders.13 Note to HSF: each MLA is relevant only to the country to which it relates (and is not cognisant of any other jurisdiction). Any country-specific points should be picked up in the relevant Rider.14 Note to HSF: this deleted detail should just be set out in Schedule 17 to avoid repetition / inadvertent contradiction.15 HSF Note: In Principal TASC is OK using this mechanism in other jurisdictions subject to agreeing the sharing percentages and conversion schedule on a country by country basis after understanding the magnitude of the relative savings and investments required in each country. Agree that these details can be inserted into the country-specific riders. 16 HSF Note: treatment of Contract Year 10 to be confirmed. 17 HSF Note; specific arrangements in respect of Algeria and Tunisia to be confirmed in country riders. 18 HSF note: It is TowerCo’s responsibility to maintain/replace the equipment as necessary and Towerco is incentivized to do this.  Using the dollar amount of investment is not an appropriate yard stick for this.   Investments are lumpy, there is inflation and costs and technologies will change.   We understand that Signal wants to ensure that TowerCo actually converted the Sites which is fine but the check should be based on the number of Energy Services Sites which should have been converted to Energy Savings Sites according to Schedule 17 less cancellations based on the then current number of Energy Savings Sites.  No mention to an investment comparison.  (Over 30 years it will be difficult to keep track of in any event)19 Note to HSF: this has been reworked to better express the principle of fairness which was discussed that OpCo’s rights to terminate Energy Services at Energy Savings Sites should be linked to the level of investment made by TowerCo. The investment doesn’t stop after Contract Year 4, because the batteries have a plausible life of 10 years.20 Note to HSF: adjustments to the Fuel Fee should be dealt with in Schedule 17.  21 Note to HSF: updated to reflect commercial agreement around application of Colo Discount at Existing Sites (see issues list from Kamil dated 13 July).22 HSF Note: this is an outstanding issue which is still subject of further discussion. Minutes of meeting where this issue was discussed to be reviewed. 23 DLA note: ‘Regions’ are applicable only to Iraq. Reference should be to ‘Territory’ in all other cases.24 	Iraq and Oman to apply from the Effective Date.25 DLA note: this clause to be updated for Iraq and Oman to make clear that Consolidation Discounts apply from the Effective Date26 HSF Note: treatment of prepayment to be addressed in working capital adjustment – not MLA. 27 Note to HSF: this should relate to the actions of the company, not to the actions of individuals who may be associated with the company. Therefore, we propose striking “personal”.28 Note to HSF: this isn’t compatible with equivalent provisions under the FWA.29 HSF Note: FWA to be updated for consistency. This provision is for the benefit of both parties, and is intended to aid in the streamlining of proceedings.  30 HSF Note: Understood that Schedule 17 for each OpCo will have the list of all Sites to be converted to DC Power (Energy Savings Sites). Schedule 17 to set out savings levels and conversion schedule for each country. 31 To be updated so that Indexation is applied up to the Effective Date from [  ] date. 32 DLA note: indexation mechanism remains an open point for commercial discussion. [HSF: noted, inclusion of indexation date of 31 Dec 2021 to be confirmed.]33 [HSF: Toyota is still reviewing the numbers in this Schedule 2. We understand that OG is in the process of updating the numbers in Schedule 2.]34 HSF Note: Values to be updated once Schedule 17 is finalised. 35 DLA note: to be updated by reference to schedule 17 once finalised36 [HSF Note: Treatment of "Difficult Access Sites", which may have limitations to 24/7 access, to be discussed and confirmed on an OpCo-by-OpCo basis, and list to be agreed. For example, some Sites may have curfews.]37 Note to HSF: as previously discussed, wouldn’t Difficult Access Sites simply fall under the ambit of Secure Sites (i.e. Sites to which special / prohibitive access arrangements apply)? Site Access Categories (i.e. 24/7, Business Hours or Secure) will be called out for each Site in the Site Schedule. Would prefer not to introduce further categories, which could further complicate the picture…38 	Subject to discussion on worked example.39 HSF Note: to clarify, this is not about resolving disputes over "interpreting" the Agreement or amendments to the material legal provisions. It's for the purpose of dealing with changes to routine commercial and operational details that don't justify an amendment to the agreement, and which would be more conveniently dealt with via this mechanism. As discussed, happy to consider incorporating this mechanism into the Joint Management Committee  Mechanism. 40 HSF Note: Schedule 17 for each territory will be jointly agreed between parties based on the different OpCo's. This Schedule 17 applies only to Iraq. 	HSF Note: Riders for territories save for Oman will, in principle, include the following clause in Schedule 17: "Subject to the Routine Maintenance Regime, TowerCo shall be permitted to replace the batteries and rectifiers at a Site or install its own batteries and rectifiers at a Site in order to convert such Sites to hybrid sites in which case TowerCo will be responsible for providing DC power to OpCo".41 Note to HSF: this Schedule 17 should work generically for any country where the Fuel Fee is relevant. It can be bespoked for each such country in that country’s Rider. HSF Note: agreed, but this version of sch 17 has been agreed using Iraq as the "reference country". While much of it will apply to each country on a generic basis, some changes may be required in relation to the country riders – eg energy savings share and conversation schedule, as well as fuel fee/reference diesel price may be different between countries.42 HSF Note: agreed on basis that Effective Date will be the start date of each MLA to be entered into in respect of a particular country. 43 Note to HSF: during the exclusivity period, the Parties may wish to explore an initial fixed amount for the DC Fee in order to avoid agreements to agree on a per Site basis. 44 DLA note: consideration being given as to what the appropriate index should be.45 HSF Notes: 1. "Fuel Price", Schedule 17: TASC noted that the prices need to be adjusted to take into account government subsidies. OG responded that this is "inherently covered already by pegging prices to relevant indices". Please can you explain this in further detail how this is captured. 2. Drafting for inclusion of DC power fee to be confirmed. Including replacement capex and opex associated with maintaining the DC power systems. TowerCo's notes that this is not a one-size fits all fee, it should be based on the DC load at the Site.  The higher the DC load, the larger and more expensive the power system required and the higher the fee.
