Act as an expert in excel and python coding. 
I have an excel file with multiple tabs. 
Most of the tabs are data input tabs.
In some cases these tabs also lookup data from other data tabs using "VLOOKUP"
The main "Analysys" tab performs calculations on this data using formulae.
Each of the columns in each of the tabs has a column title, thought in some cases the title is in row1, and in other cases in row 2 or row 3.

I would now like to 
- use the excel file solely as a data source
- replace all the excel formulae with python code
- create a python code that reads the data in the excel file and writes the results back to a copy of this file
- Many of the excel formulae use VLookups which reference data in other tabs using a column number.  For the python formulae rather than using column numbers, I would like to use the column title.  This will make the python code easier to understand and maintain.

Please review this file and give an overview of the key steps that we should follow to achieve this outcome. 

I would like to have a situation where
- the tabs contain only data
